Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Net** | Weedwood Stick (3) + Reed Rope (4) |  |

Catching
----------

The Net can be used to catch Fireflies, Geckos, Dragonflies, Chiromaw Hatchlings, Tamed Chiromaws, Tamed Lightning Chiromaws, and Sludge Worm Egg Sacs. Right-clicking on one of these creatures with the Net will catch it, consuming durability in the process, and it will then appear in the player's inventory as an item. Right-clicking on the ground with the item will release the creature as an entity again.

Captured creatures have various uses, such as Geckos for testing in a Gecko Cage, Fireflies to be crafted into Lanterns, Fireflies *or* Dragonflies to serve as pullers for the Draeton, or Chiromaw Hatchlings to be raised into Tamed Chiromaws.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Net can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Net** | Damaged **Net** + Sulfur (3-8) + Life Crystal (4-10% charge) |  |

Corrosion & Middle Gems
-------------------------

The Net does not corrode, nor can it be applied with Middle Gems.
