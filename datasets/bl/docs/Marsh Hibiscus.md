Collection
------------

Marsh Hibiscus must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops a Marsh Hibiscus Flower, which can then be ground into Ground Marsh Hibiscus.

Growing
---------

Marsh Hibiscus will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Marsh Hibiscus can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. It can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Marsh Hibiscus has a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
