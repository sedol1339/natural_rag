Coloration

Weedwood Leaves take on different foliage colors depending on what biome they are in. The foliage color is:

* #48B518 if in the inventory
* #A8A800 to  #A87800 in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes

* #D36423 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #52AF5A to  #85AF51 in Swamplands biomes
* #52AF5A in Swamplands Clearing biomes

Particles
-----------

Small leaf particles will fall around Weedwood Leaves.

Decay
-------

Like other leaves, natural Weedwood Leaves spontaneously decay and disappear when they receive a block tick if they are not connected to any living wood block.

Weedwood Leaves placed by the player will never naturally decay.

Collection
------------

When decayed or harvested normally, Weedwood Leaves usually drop nothing, but have a chance to drop a Weedwood Sapling. The leaf blocks themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Compostability
----------------

Weedwood Leaves have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 4. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Weedwood Leaves will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
