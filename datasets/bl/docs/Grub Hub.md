Usage
-------

A Grub Hub surrounded by Weedwood Bushes.

A Grub Hub will interact with Weedwood Bushes placed in a 3x3 square 1 block below itself. Weedwood Bushes that become infested with grubs will automatically be harvested. If the hub is given Pheromone Extract via a bucket, it will re-infuse the surrounding bushes with pheromones, starting the process over again.

The hub only has one internal inventory slot. If allowed to fill before running out of Pheromone Extract, it will not harvest the grubs, allowing the bushes to progress through their stages.

The Grub Hub will interact with Hoppers, Syrmorite Hoppers, and Water Filters.

Trivia
--------

* Its name is likely a reference to the american fast food delivery service "Grubhub", which was heavily mocked throughout 2020 for its poorly-recieved "Delivery Dance" commercial.
