Mud Bricks ingame

**Mud Bricks** are craftable building blocks. They have a normal variant, and four increasingly Sludgy variants that use connected textures. In addition to being crafted, the normal variant can also be found as part of Sludge Plains Ruins, and all variants can be found as part of the Sludgeon. The level of "sludginess" increases with deeper levels.
