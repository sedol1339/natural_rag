Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Spores drop commonly from Sporelings upon death.

Properties
------------

### Farming
Spores can be planted in Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass that has been fertilized with Compost. The spores grow into a Yellow Dotted Fungus crop that will produce edible Yellow Dotted Fungus.

Yellow Dotted Fungus crops will grow over time until ready to be harvested. Its growth can be augmented with Ground Dried Swamp Reed. When harvested at full maturity, the crop will drop Yellow Dotted Fungus and more Spores.

However, a Yellow Dotted Fungus crop's growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on become decayed. If the crop is mature when this happens, it will decay as well, dropping nothing but Spores and detaching the fungus part of the crop as a live Sporeling.

Uses
------

### Compostability
Spores can be composted in a Compost Bin. They have a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 10. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
