Placement
-----------

Cryptweed can only be placed on the underside of blocks, as well as directly below itself. Breaking a higher part of a Cryptweed growth will break all parts below it as well.

Particles
-----------

Cryptweed will occasionally drip water particles.

Collection
------------

Cryptweed must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Cryptweed Blades, which can then be ground into Ground Cryptweed.

Growth
--------

Cryptweed that has been placed directly by the player grows down from blocks like Vines. Like other Sludgeon plants, it must also be placed in the range of an active Censer that is being sourced with Bottled Fog in order to grow. Instead of being placed directly in the fog, the top part of the growth must be placed between one and four blocks above the fog.

Compostability
----------------

Cryptweed has a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 8. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
