Usage
-------

Left-clicking the tackle box will open or close its lid. While closed, the player can right click the top of the Box to sit on it. Right clicking while open will access its inventory.

### Inventory
The Fishing Tackle Box's GUI features a small 16 slot inventory and a 2x2 crafting grid. When broken, it keeps its inventory, much like a vanilla Shulker Box.

Lurker Skin Pouches and other Tackle Boxes cannot be placed inside of it.
