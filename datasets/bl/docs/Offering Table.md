Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Offering Tables can sometimes generate next to Simulacra throughout The Betweenlands (such as in the Cavern or Lake Cavern layers or on the Giant Roots holding up Raised Islands in Raised Isles biomes), with an item already inside of them.

Properties
------------

### Displaying Items
Similarly to Item Shelves, right-clicking an Offering Table with an item or stack of items will store it, putting it on display. Up to a single full stack of the same item can be stored at once. The item or stack can be taken back by right-clicking.

Offering Tables are directional and can be placed in 4 different cardinal directions based on where the player is facing.

### Menhir Teleportation
When a Bone Wayfinder is placed on an Offering Table, any players in a small radius around it can hold shift to use the wayfinder for teleportation. While a player is shifting, their XP will be drained over time and gray particles will build up in the surrounding area for several seconds before the player teleports back to the Menhir the Bone Wayfinder is linked to. Teleportation is only successful if the wayfinder is linked to a Menhir and if the teleporting player has enough XP.

Compared to using the Bone Wayfinder normally, this method allows for multiple players to use a stationary position to teleport and does *not* require sky exposure to function, but will leave the wayfinder behind at the teleportation point. Note that teleporting this way will still use the wayfinder's durability.

### Spirit Fruit Offering
When a Spirit Fruit is placed on an Offering Table next to a Simulacrum with a certain effect, a single fruit will be consumed to activate the effect. The details of this are hidden below in a spoiler tab.

| --- |
| If the Simulacrum has the Blessing effect, the Offering Table will generate a shower of blue particles around itself when a player gets near it. Upon standing in the particles for a few seconds, the Spirit Fruit will be consumed, and the player will be granted the  Blessed effect, which prevents them from dying once, leaving them with 50% of their maximum health remaining. However, there is a twist - either the player will be revived on the spot, *or* they will be teleported back to the Offering Table's location in the process and be inflicted with the  Blindness II effect for 3 seconds. Additionally, revival consumes all of the player's XP and drops only a fraction of it, if any, at the point where they would have died. The Blessed effect will not go away until 10 seconds after being revived, and more Spirit Fruits will not be consumed from the Offering Table until the effect is no longer active. |

Loot
------

The loot in naturally generated Offering Tables is derived from three identical loot tables:

* deepman\_simulacrum\_offerings is used by Offering Tables found next to Deepman Simulacra.
* lake\_cavern\_simulacrum\_offerings is used by Offering Tables found next to Lake Cavern Simulacra.
* rootman\_simulacrum\_offerings is used by Offering Tables found next to Rootman Simulacra.

The following is a list of all of the items that can be found naturally in Offering Tables, including their rolls, quantities, and weights.

| Simulacrum Offerings | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dropped Item** | **Quantity** | **Weight** |
| 1 Roll: | | |
| **Ball of Sap** | 1 | 1/7 (14.29%) |
