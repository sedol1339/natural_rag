| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Moss Bed** | Moss or Moss (item) or Cave Moss or Cave Moss (item) (3) + Weedwood Planks (3) |  |

Setting Spawn
---------------

When placed in The Betweenlands, the Moss Bed can be right-clicked to set the player's spawn point for the dimension to their current location. However, since there is no proper day/night cycle, the bed cannot be used to actually sleep and skip any "night", not even through the Rift event.

Regular Beds cannot be used in The Betweenlands, so making a Moss Bed is necessary to set spawns in the dimension.

Other Dimensions
------------------

If placed in The Overworld, the Moss Bed acts exactly like a regular Bed, allowing one to skip night as well as stop rain in addition to setting their spawn point.

If placed in The Nether or The End, the Moss Bed will explode into flames when a player attempts to use it, like a regular Bed would.

History
