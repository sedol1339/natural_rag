A Monster Spawner ingame

A Tar Beast Spawner

The **Monster Spawner** of the Betweenlands has a unique, animated spinning model, as well as its own particle effect, and can be found in Druid Circles, Shrines, Underground Oases, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress. It also has a Tar Beast variant disguised as a Solid Tar block, which only generates at the bottom of Tar Pool Dungeons.

Spawning
----------

Betweenlands Monster Spawners act like any Spawner, periodically and endlessly spawning one or more of a particular mob when a player is nearby. They have a different mob assigned to them depending on the structure type. They can be broken with a pickaxe to stop them from spawning additional mobs.

All of the Monster Spawners in a Cragrock Tower must be destroyed before the tower can be considered "completed." Each Monster Spawner destroyed will open a stairway to a room above.

Mob Spawns
------------

The following are the mobs that Betweenlands Monster Spawners can spawn:

* Druid Circles: Dark Druids
* Shrines and Underground Oases: Swamp Hags, Wights, Blood Snails, Leeches, Termites
* Tar Pool Dungeons: Tar Beasts
* Cragrock Towers and the Wight Fortress: Swamp Hags, Wights, Chiromaws, Pyrads, Termites

Reactivating the Druid Spawner
--------------------------------

The Monster Spawner of a Druid Circle will be destroyed upon assembling the Swamp Talisman in the Dark Druid Altar above it. In case the player wants to fight the Dark Druids that spawned from it again for more Talisman Pieces, they can place four Saplings of any variety in the four corner slots of the Dark Druid Altar assembly interface. The saplings will float up in the usual assembly animation, and once they come together, the spawner will be recreated.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Reactivates Dark Druid **Monster Spawner** | Any Sapling (4) |  |

Collection
------------

Like vanilla spawners, Betweenlands Monster Spawners drop a large amount of experience when harvested. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in any way.
