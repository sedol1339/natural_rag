Trap
------

Possessed Blocks hide among the walls of the Wight Fortress, and appear to be exactly the same as regular Betweenstone Bricks. However, when a player comes within a couple of blocks of its "possessed" side, a screaming skeletal entity will leap out of it. This entity travels out about a block or so, emits white particles, and deals 2 damage () and a considerable amount of knockback to whatever it touches, most likely the player who triggered it. It will remain there for 2 seconds before vanishing, and has a cooldown of about 10 seconds before it can strike again.

Collection
------------

Possessed Blocks drop regular Betweenstone Bricks when harvested. Unlike most blocks, they do not have block protection in the Wight Fortress. The blocks themselves cannot be harvested in any way.
