Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Silk Mask | Reed Rope (3) + Silk Thread (3) |  |

Stats
-------

The mask provides no protection in terms of armor, however, it will make the player immune to spore based attacks from Splodeshrooms or Puffshrooms.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Silk Mask can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs Silk Mask | Damaged Silk Mask + Sulfur (5-8) + Life Crystal (4-7% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Silk Mask can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
