The **Chirobarb Erupter** is unique weapon that can be dropped from the Chiromaw Matriarch. It can be upgraded into a shock variant.

Attacking
-----------

Upon use, the regular chirobarb erupter shoots two waves of chiromaw barbs in a 360° circle around the player. Each projectile deals 7 damage () to any entity it touches.

Upgrading
-----------

The chirobarb erupter can be upgraded into a lightning variant which receives an enchanted glint if the item is struck by a betweenlands thunder bolt. Do note that the resulting item can burn if it is left in the fire created by lightning.

Upon hitting an entity, the shock erupter's projectiles deal 9 damage (). Additionally, a shock barb emits a burst of electricity upon hitting an entity if there is one or more other entities nearby, chaining a bolt towards each of them and damaging them as well. The shock can spread by traveling through multiple entities in a chain up to a varying limit, even through blocks, damaging each of them (including any entities mounted on top of them). Under normal circumstances, any entity within a 9x9x9 area centered on any entity that is struck by the arrow or its shock is within range to be shocked (as long as it was not already struck by the same burst before), and each bolt can chain through 2-4 entities.
