Usage
-------

While the player has a Net in the inventory, holding the Weedwood Fishing Rod will automatically place the Net in the offhand. Right click with the Weedwood Fishing Rod to cast a lure. Right click again to reel it in. Fish are more likely to bite if the rod is baited. Once a fish bites, the Fishing mini-game begins.

### Baiting
The Weedwood Fishing Rod can be baited by either crafting the rod with a Tiny Sludge Worm or left clicking a Silt Glass Jar that contains Tiny Sludge Worms.
