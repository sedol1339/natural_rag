The Weedwood Chest ingame

The **Weedwood Chest** is a craftable utility block that is the equivalent of the vanilla Chest for the Betweenlands. In addition to being crafted, they can also be found as part of Idol Head Statues, Shrines, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress, filled with unique loot.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

Storage
---------

The storage interface can be accessed by right-clicking the Weedwood Chest. Like the vanilla Chest, the Weedwood Chest contains 27 individual slots for storing blocks and items in, and can be combined with another adjacent Weedwood Chest to form a double chest with 54 slots. The chest can only be opened if there is not a solid block directly above it.

Due to how Corrosion in the Betweenlands works, corrodable items that are inside any storage container, including a Weedwood Chest, will stop corroding, only resuming if they are taken out of the chest.

Loot
------

The loot in naturally generating Weedwood Chests is derived from two primary loot tables:

* common\_chest\_loot is used by chests in Idol Head Statues. It generally contains more basic loot.
* dungeon\_chest\_loot is used by chests in Shrines, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress. It generally contains high-end and valuable loot, including exclusive items.

Visit the Loot Tables page for the full list of all loot that can be found inside of Weedwood Chests.

Fuel
------

The Weedwood Chest can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per chest block.
