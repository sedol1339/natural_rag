**Heavy Rain** is a weather event that can occur semi-uncommonly in The Betweenlands. While visually and mechanically similar to Rain in The Overworld, it also consists of various exclusive gameplay changes.

This event cannot occur while the Winter seasonal event is also occurring.

Effects

Torches will extinguish during the event

Tunnel Entrances containing various Sludge Worms generate during the event

During the Heavy Rain event, rain will pour down constantly from the sky of the dimension, creating rippling puddle-like particles upon contacting a block. The stars in the sky will fade completely out of visibility. As with vanilla Rain, Fire will be put out faster and entities that are on fire will be extinguished upon contact with the rain, alongside other interactions with blocks and mobs that vanilla Rain has. However, Heavy Rain has its own unique sounds compared to vanilla Rain.

There are several additional, significant gameplay changes during the Heavy Rain event:

* Puddles will generate randomly over time on top of opaque blocks that are exposed to the rain. These can then spread to adjacent blocks, even if those blocks are *not* exposed to the rain. They will destroy most crops (White Pear Plants, Yellow Dotted Fungus, and Aspectrus Plants) that they generate over - crops that have cover above and to the sides of them will be protected. Puddles will disappear over time after the event ends.
* Sulfur Torches that are exposed to the rain will extinguish over time, turning into Extinguished Sulfur Torches. Extinguished torches can be relit by right-clicking them with an Octine Ingot or by smelting them. Other light sources, such as Lanterns, can be used as alternatives to torches that will not be extinguished in the rain.
* Purifiers and Infusers that are exposed to the rain will slowly fill up with rainwater over time.
* Fireflies and Geckos will seek shelter from the rain under blocks. Geckos may also shelter from the rain by hiding inside of a Weedwood Bush.
* Tunnel Entrances will generate randomly over time in the ground throughout the surface landscape. These entrances will start spawning Tiny Sludge Worms, Small Sludge Worms, and Large Sludge Worms when a player comes near, and will spawn many before disappearing. They will also disappear immediately after the event ends.
* A certain Simulacrum effect will only activate while this event is active.

### Sub-Event
The Thunderstorm sub-event can only occur while the Heavy Rain event is also occurring. This accompanies the Heavy Rain effects with occasional Lightning strikes that thrash the landscape.

### Prediction
The Wind Chime forecast visual for the Heavy Rain event

The Heavy Rain event can be predicted up to 5 minutes before it starts by a Wind Chime, or up to 10 minutes before if it is attuned to the event.

When forecasting, a forecast visual will emanate from the Wind Chime, and a unique chime jingle sound will play:
