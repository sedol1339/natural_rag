*"...and here you have your peat mummy, a vicious creature of pure malice that can send the most adventurous of ye' back into your scrawny holes."*

> *-From Mutants of Terror*

**Peat Mummies** are undead mobs that spawn uncommonly in Marsh and Sludge Plains biomes, and at a heavily increased rate during the Blood Sky event.

They are also occasionally summoned by the Dreadful Peat Mummy with a lower health value.

Description
-------------

Peat Mummies appear as mummified, bloody skeletons crawling on all fours. They spawn submerged within an area of 3x3x2 blocks, where the top layer is made of Mud or Peat.

When a player comes within six blocks, they will rise out of the mud and slowly crawl towards them, dealing basic melee damage on contact. They can also scream occasionally, causing the screen to shake, greatly increasing their speed and damage for a few seconds. They also take no knockback.

### Peat Mummy Rider
Peat Mummies can also spawn with a Swamp Hag riding them as a jockey. The Swamp Hag will throw Tiny Sludge Worms at the player. While riding the Peat Mummy, the Swamp Hag can still be possessed by a Wight, though this will hurt the Peat Mummy.

Strategy
----------

Peat Mummies are generally slow, but can easily catch the player off-guard when they surface. If the player gets stuck in Mud or Peat while fleeing, they can deal considerable damage, as they have a lot of health and cannot be knocked back. Because of this, players should consider sticking to ranged attacks, especially Basilisk Arrows to freeze them in place, while also being mindful of their surroundings as to not get stuck. Rubber Boots can also be worn to prevent this.

Bark Amulets can also be equipped to see a buried mummy before the player gets too close, as its health is still shown even while buried. Submerged Peat Mummies can then safely be killed from a distance, as their hitbox is still present, and they won't react to damage.

### Shimmerstone Distraction
Shimmerstones can be thrown with right-click to distract a Peat Mummy from its target. When thrown, any Peat Mummy within a considerable distance will run towards the item, hovering over it for a few seconds, before collecting it. Distracted Peat Mummies also completely ignore attacks, allowing them to be killed safely. After the stone is picked up, they will become hostile again.
