**Sludge Plains** are Betweenlands biomes characterized by large masses of relatively flat, very muddy land covered in sludge, with dead foliage, sparse Rotten Weedwood Trees, and dirty rivers of Swamp Water occasionally breaking up the land. It is the rarest of all biomes in the Betweenlands, and one of the most dangerous and difficult biomes to traverse as well.

Sludge Plains have a **Clearing** sub-biome that can rarely spawn in small areas within normal Sludge Plains biomes, surrounded by Swamp Water.

* Mud, on the surface and underwater
* Swamp Dirt, in patches and directly under the surface
* Sludgy Dirt, in patches
* Middle Gem Ores, occasionally underwater
* Hollow Log, occasionally

Notes
-------

* It is recommended for players to obtain and wear Rubber Boots before attempting to traverse this biome, due to the high quantity of Mud.
  + Note that Rubber Boots will not improve the ability to walk on Sludgy Dirt, however.
* It is recommended to not fight the Dreadful Peat Mummy in this biome because of the dangers here. Instead do it in the Marsh or Sludge Plains Clearing biomes.
* Middle Gem Ores generate more often in Sludge Plains than in other biomes.
