Portal Frames ingame

**Portal Frames** are the wood blocks of the Portal Tree, as well as the frame and platform base of any individual Tree Portal to The Betweenlands. They have a normal rotatable variant, a variant with bark on all sides, and 8 other variants that make up the intricate design surrounding each portal.

Contents
--------

* 1 Collection
* 2 Fuel
* 3 Maintaining Portals
* 4 History

Collection
------------

The normal rotatable and bark-only variants of Portal Frame drop themselves when harvested like most blocks.

However, the intricately designed Portal Frame variants will always drop the plain bark-only variant of Portal Frame when harvested normally. These must be harvested with a Silk Touch tool to be collected themselves.

Fuel
------

Any variant of Portal Frame can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per frame block.

Maintaining Portals
---------------------

The intricately designed Portal Frames surround and maintain each two-by-one Tree Portal to The Betweenlands. Should a non-corner block that is part of this frame be destroyed, the center Tree Portal will be destroyed as well.

However, Tree Portals can be repaired by building a three-by-four frame out of any Portal Frame block, in the same shape that Tree Portals appear individually or on the Portal Tree. Right-clicking on the base of this frame with the Swamp Talisman will reignite the Tree Portal within and the Portal Frame blocks used will be rearranged into the usual design surrounding each portal.

History
---------

* Release 3.3.2: Can now be used to reignite a Tree Portal.
* Release 3.3.0: Made plain full bark variant obtainable.
* Beta 2.0.0: Now generates on all outside parts of the Portal Tree, taking on a plain bark texture on most parts of the trunk and replacing the separate Portal Tree Bark block.
* **Beta 1.0.0**: Introduced.
