# Aspects

**Aspects** are a mechanic used in Herblore. They are semi-magical properties found in plants, minerals and even pieces of creatures. They are the key to brewing Infusions.

Where Aspects Are Found
-------------------------

Aspects as listed inside the Herblore Book

Aspects are randomly distributed to Ground Items, including Ground Dried Swamp Reed, among tiers and groups. The distribution depends on the world seed. Aspects themselves don't have a defined effect, only a classification of what they could affect. Aspects always have the same classification. This does not depend on the world seed. **The aspect/s on an item, *if they have been discovered and if an Herblore Book is in the inventory,* can be viewed by mousing over it in your inventory while holding shift, which will also display its icon.** Lower tier aspect items often have multiple low tier aspects while higher tier aspect items usually have a single high tier aspect.

Some Ground Items have exceptions to the usual distribution rule:

* Ground Middle Gems will always contain one specific aspect only. Ground Aqua Middle Gem always contains Byrginaz, Ground Crimson Middle Gem always contains Firnalaz, and Ground Green Middle Gem always contains Fergalaz.
* Ground Items derived exclusively from the Sludgeon, specifically Ground Cryptweed, Edge Leaf, Edge Moss, Edge Shroom, Pale Grass, Rotbulb, and String Roots, will always contain Wodren and/or Uduriis in addition to other aspects. They are the only Ground Items that can contain these aspects.

A single aspect is also always found on an Aspect Vial, a player-created aspect item that can be used alternatively to ground items in brewing infusions. Each item an Aspect is found on has a specific decimal amount; the amounts are added if an infused aspect is combined from two separate items, determining the number of Infusions that can be obtained from that one bucket.

A single aspect can be farmed from an Aspectrus Plant by planting it near an active Censer that is being sourced with an Aspect Vial containing the aspect you wish to farm. The same aspect can be found on the Aspectrus Fruit and Seeds that plant drops; Aspectrus Fruit can be used as another infusion-brewing alternative.

A final item that can contain aspects is Sap Spit, which is obtained from Spirit Trees. This item is unique in that it always contains just the aspects Ordaniis and Yeowynn, regardless of the world. These are the exact aspects needed to create an Elixir of Healing. However, like Ground Items, the aspects will still not be displayed on the item until it is tested.

Aspects can be stored within Aspect Vials as well as placed Dentrothyst Vials. Placed vials act as containers that can be filled with Aspect Vials to store up to 5.0 amount of a single Aspect.

Making Use of Aspects
-----------------------

Gecko testing

Aspects must be first discovered on items through a test. Aspects have a certain effect (derived from previously mentioned classifications) on Geckos, e.g. nausea, sweat etc. (this is only for the gecko test, it does NOT affect the potion effect in the end). Geckos can be tested by right-clicking a Gecko Cage (that has a Gecko inside) with the Ground Item you wish to test. Doing the gecko test may change the appearance of the Gecko based on the general theme of the aspect tested, or display particle effects; It will also display a message in text telling one of the aspects on the item, and gives the Herblore Book an entry with the found effects and their corresponding aspects that caused it (and the strength of the occurred effects, hinting at the amount of the corresponding aspect). It may also display a second message to say that all aspects on the item have been discovered. From then on, you will be able to view the aspect on the item with the shift key when the Herblore Book is in the inventory.

Certain combinations of aspects yield functioning Infusions in the Alembic, while some don't. Infusing any non-valid combination of aspects (or infusing a combination and collecting it at the incorrect time) and putting the resulting Infusion Bucket in the Alembic will yield Aspect Vials containing individual aspects. These vials can be used in the Infuser as aspect ingredients but are not actual infusions; this serves as a way of separating aspects from a single item that contains multiple. The decimal amount in the aspects is added up and may determine the length or potency of the resulting Infusion, depending on the aspect type; Aspect Vials used in crafting require a specified amount.

The aspect Byariis (corruption) creates the negative counterpart of an infusion if it's in the brew. Even numbers of ingredients with Byariis cause the outcome to have a positive effect, while odd numbers cause the outcome to have a negative effect. The amount of Byariis doesn't affect the outcome; only the presence matters.

Aspects in Infusion Buckets and Aspect Vials have a specified amount, shown in their tooltip; the resulting number of infusions depends on the sum of all amounts of the mixed aspects. Strength and duration are affected by the amount of two aspects for strength and duration. Which aspects affect duration and/or strength depends on the infusion recipe. Normal infusions have a fixed recipe that doesn't depend on the world seed. Which aspects affect strength and/or duration of the infusion is mentioned in the potion recipe. Special infusions have a random recipe that depends on the world seed. Recipes for said special infusions can be found as loot and will add an Herblore entry when read.

Types of Aspects
------------------

These are all of the Aspects categorized alphabetically, their tier (which determines the general types of ground items they can be found on and in what quantity aspects can be found on an individual item), and what Infusions they can be made into. See the Infusions page for the specific combinations of Aspects required to make each Infusion.
