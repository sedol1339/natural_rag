Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Spirit Fruits can drop rarely from breaking any variant of Spirit Tree Leaves, or when they naturally decay.

### Loot
Spirit Fruits can be found as Loot from Offering Tables that sometimes generate next to Simulacra throughout The Betweenlands.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Spirit Fruits restore 4 hunger and 4.8 saturation. They also grant the  Regeneration II effect for 5 seconds, and the  Absorption effect for 2 minutes. They can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is already full.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Spirit Fruits have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Spirit Fruits only restore 1 hunger () when eaten, a third of the original hunger value (rounded down).

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Simulacra Offering
When a Spirit Fruit is placed on an Offering Table next to a Simulacrum with a certain effect, a single fruit will be consumed to activate the effect. The details of this are hidden below in a spoiler tab.

| Offering Details (SPOILER WARNING) |
| --- |
| If the Simulacrum has the Blessing effect, the Offering Table will generate a shower of blue particles around itself when a player gets near it. Upon standing in the particles for a few seconds, the Spirit Fruit will be consumed, and the player will be granted the  Blessed effect, which prevents them from dying once, leaving them with 50% of their maximum health remaining. However, there is a twist - either the player will be revived on the spot, *or* they will be teleported back to the Offering Table's location in the process and be inflicted with the  Blindness II effect for 3 seconds. Additionally, revival consumes all of the player's XP and drops only a fraction of it, if any, at the point where they would have died. The Blessed effect will not go away until 10 seconds after being revived, and more Spirit Fruits will not be consumed from the Offering Table until the effect is no longer active. |
