#### Coating
Scabyst can be used to "coat" any Betweenlands Tools and Weapons affected by Corrosion (encompassing Shovels, Pickaxes, Axes, Swords and other melee weapons, Bows, the Simple Slingshot, and the Sickle). This will keep the item's Corrosion from increasing any further until the Scabyst coating eventually wears off. Coated items can still have their corrosion level *decreased* by other methods, without removing any Scabyst coating on the item in the process.

Coating, similar to corrosion, is a value between 0 and 600 on equipment, initially at 0. The exact value out of 600 can be viewed as a tooltip on the affected item when Advanced Tooltips are toggled on (F3+H). Otherwise, coating is represented by four tooltips for each stage:

* ***Barely any coating left***: 0-99 coating points
* ***Slightly coated***: 100-199 coating points
* ***Moderately coated***: 200-399 coating points
* ***Well coated***: 400-600 coating points

Each piece of Scabyst applied to the equipment gives it 75 coating points, and any number between 1 and 8 can be crafted with the equipment at once. The points will deplete over time, and as long as the value is above 0, the equipment's corrosion level will not increase any further. The equipment will stay coated until the coating points are fully depleted.
