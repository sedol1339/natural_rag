Spawning
----------

The Chiromaw Matriarch spawns perched over a Chiromaw Matriarch Nest on a Raised Island in a Raised Isles biome, watching over Chiromaw Hatchlings. Only one Chiromaw Matriarch can exist at a time per nest, but multiple nests can spawn in close proximity of each other, resulting in multiple matriarchs domineering a wide area.

### Respawning
If a Chiromaw Matriarch is killed, one will eventually respawn from its original Chiromaw Matriarch Nest as long as no player has stood on the center block of the nest; otherwise, it will not respawn.

Behavior
----------

Occasionally, the Chiromaw Matriarch will fly away from its Chiromaw Matriarch Nest, often to hunt something, but will eventually return to it. It tends to visit other Raised Islands and sometimes lands on other nests.

It can pick up the player dealing damage over time before throwing/dropping them, drop bombs that leave an area of effect that causes blindness, or launch barbs that stun the player.

Strategy
----------

A shield can protect the players from the barb's stun effect. When the Matriarch grabs the players, they can hit it with anything they have in order for the creature to drop them, letting them fall. If a Matriarch carries the player high enough, falling back near the nest (otherwise the creature will lose interest) will offer them plenty of time to shoot projectiles, as the Matriarch takes a long time to come back. Keep in mind that the Matriarch is immune to the stunning effects of Basilisk Arrows and Chiromaw Barbs.

The Ring of Ascent and the Volarkite can allow players to survive falls when the Matriarch drops them.
