**Coarse Islands** are Betweenlands biomes characterized by large, steep islands with their shores rising a block above the surrounding Swamp Water, with some Weedwood and Sap Trees and several Giant Roots intertwining throughout the biome.

There is an additional variant, the **Raised Isles**, that can spawn independently of the normal variant and contains slightly different topography.
