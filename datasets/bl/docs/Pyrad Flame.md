Pyrad Flames when fired by the player

**Pyrad Flame** is a special item which drops from Pyrads that are killed while charging up their flame attack.

Flame Attack
--------------

When right-clicked, Pyrad Flame launches an inaccurate spread of between one and five Pyrad fireballs, in the same fashion a Pyrad would launch fireballs at its adversaries. These fireballs are not affected by gravity, deal contact damage, and can set players, mobs and blocks on fire. Each item has only one use.

History

* **Beta 1.0.0**: Introduced, but unobtainable.
