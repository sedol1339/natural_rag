### Crafting Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leaf (3) | Fallen Leaves |  |

### Drops
Most Plant Items drop from breaking their corresponding plant source with a Sickle. Some plant items, specifically Black Hat Mushroom items, Bulb-Capped Mushrooms, Flathead Mushroom items, Tangled Roots/Giant Root, Swamp Kelp items, and Weedwood Logs/Dry Bark, do not require a Sickle to be collected from their source.

Most Plant Items can also drop from Root Sprites, *except* for items which do not require a Sickle from their normal source.

### Loot
Plant Items from plants based in the Sludgeon, specifically Cryptweed Blades, Edge Leaf items, Edge Moss Clumps, Edge Shroom Gills, Pale Grass Blades, Rotbulb Stalks, and String Root Fibers, can be found as Loot from Item Shelves in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon.
