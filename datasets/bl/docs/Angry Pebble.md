**Angry Pebbles** are unique throwable items. In addition to being animated, they can also drop from Boulder Sprites and can be found as Loot from pots in Tar Pool Dungeons, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress. There are two variants - a normal Angry Pebble, and a craftable **Inanimate Angry Pebble** that can be animated into normal Angry Pebbles.

Uses
------

### Throwing
Holding down right-click with an Angry Pebble causes it to begin pulling back, flashing red, smoking and hissing, which is a warning sign for its destructive nature. If you let go of the key before the pebble pulls back all the way, it will not be thrown. This prevents it from being accidentally thrown and causing unintended destruction.

When let go at full pullback, the Angry Pebble will be thrown, yell, and create a significant explosion upon contacting a block or entity. This explosion destroys many blocks and can damage multiple mobs, but the block damage can be negated by Swamp Water.

Trivia
--------

* For a long period of time during development, Angry Pebbles used a sound effect of a text-to-speech voice saying "inoffensive sound effect". This was a reference to their original temporary joke sound effect, which had complaints made about it for being offensive.
* Use your imagination.
