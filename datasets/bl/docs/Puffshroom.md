Puffshrooms ingame

**Puffshrooms** are special trap blocks that are found in the 5th, 6th, and 7th layers of the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon.

Trap
------

Puffshrooms hide in the floors of the Sludgeon vaults, and appear similar to Cracked Mud Tiles, but are distinguishable by their green pulsating top animation. When a player comes within a couple blocks of its animated side, a strange fungus will unfurl out of it, and after a second it will shoot up a jet of glowing orange spores. This causes nearby players to drop the item/s they are currently holding in their main hand. The fungus will remain unfurled for about a second before retreating back into its block, and has a cooldown of about 1.5 seconds before it can emerge again.

Collection
------------

Puffshrooms are simply removed when harvested normally, turning into Cracked Mud Tiles and dropping nothing. When harvested with Syrmorite Shears, they are removed instantly and drop 1-2 Puffshroom Tendrils. Unlike most blocks, they do not have block protection in the Sludgeon.

Puffshrooms themselves cannot be collected in any way.
