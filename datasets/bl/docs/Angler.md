Description
-------------

They give off a small amount of blue light from their bulb on their head when using the mod's shaders. They will swim around in big groups in the rivers and lakes, but if they spot the player they will rapidly swim towards them and attack. One bite only deals a small amount of damage, however they attack rapidly and in quite big groups. If the player manages to reach land they will continue to attack, leaping out of the water to get to them. However, this grounds the fish, and they will flop around and then die unless they get back into the water before suffocating. To note, this leap can sometimes launch them 10 blocks to one's left or right, if they were moving out of the way (though sometimes they are instead inaccurate), leaving them completely grounded without much chance to come back to land.

Strategy
----------

Especially in the early game, Anglers can be a dangerous threat to anyone in or even close to the water, and in large schools even more so. The best way to deal with them if unprepared is to get out of the water and move a good number of blocks inland, for they will leap out of the water to continue pursuit. By doing this, they often end up drowning themselves and you can take their drops. Once you have decent equipment they are, for the most part, not as much of a problem as they would be otherwise.

Although, Anglers always spawn near Lurkers and will immediately be attacked by said Lurkers. They will normally target the Lurker for being attacked, out of retaliation, though will prioritize the Player if they are nearby. Lurkers, if it's a one on one, will always win the battle, with at least a little health.
