### Silk Producing
Silk Threads are produced over time by a Moth House containing one or more Silk Grubs. The rate at which the grubs produce silk depends on the efficiency of the Moth House, which can be augmented by placing Lanterns nearby. Up to 6 grubs can be inside a Moth House at once, and each grub can produce a maximum of 3 Silk Threads before being used up.
