The Barrishee's damaged backside.

The **Barrishee** is a powerful chief mob that spawns upon opening a Dungeon Door Mimic. One can always be found on the 4th layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults in the Sludgeon.

When music is turned on, the Barrishee Music track will play during the fight.

Appearance
------------

The Barrishee is a mechanical creature that appears to be comprised mainly of mud brick and rotten wood. It drags itself along with its arms as it moves, as its lower body appears to be damaged, one leg replaced by a large wooden gear, and a flat wooden plank in place of the other. Its face resembles the runes seen on Dungeon Doors, and its teeth possess a similar yellowish glow. The Barrishee is very large, taking up nearly the whole width of the Vault's tunnels. It also features a prominent crest around its head.

Description
-------------

When the Dungeon Door Mimic is unlocked, either with the combination or a Rune Door Key, the door will collapse outwards, spawning the Barrishee behind it.

Opening the Dungeon Door Mimic will grant access to the Barrishee Lair, which contains a double chest filled with loot, including a Ring of Gathering, and an Ancient Battle Axe embedded in the mud.

Strategy
----------

When targeting a player, the Barrishee will periodically scream, glowing with an orange shader effect and breaking nearby blocks. This scream will also cause Urns of Chance (including the urns inside Dungeon Alcoves) to break, which always spawns aggressive Ash Sprites.

Outside of its scream and normal melee contact damage, the Barrishee has two other attacks it can use:

* **Sonic Blast**: It will scream and emit a sonic blast from its mouth which, on top of breaking blocks, will deal damage to the player and knock them back.
* **Shockwave**: It will slam the ground, sending a small shockwave similar to those created by the Shockwave Sword. This will deal damage and knock the hit player up slightly.

Drops
-------

Trivia
--------

* The Barrishee's model originally lacked a head crest - it was added so that it would block the player's visibility in the narrow tunnels and make it appear more intimidating.

History
---------

* Release 3.7.1: Updated Spawn Egg colors.
* Release 3.7.0: Added music track.
* Beta 3.5.0: Introduced.
