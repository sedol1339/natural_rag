Obtaining

### Crafting Recipe

### Smelting Recipe

| **Valonite Splinter** + 0.1 XP | Any Valonite Tool or Valonite Armor piece + Any fuel |  |

### Trimming
Valonite Splinters can be obtained from trimming a *treasure* Anadia item with Stubby body type (that is not rotten) in the Trimming Table. The amount obtained per item depends on the Anadia's Size attribute, with larger sizes yielding more splinters.

### Drops
Valonite Splinters can drop very rarely from Crypt Crawlers upon death, and very rarely from Tiny Sludge Worms if they are squashed to death.

### Loot
Valonite Splinters can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underground Ruins, Tar Pool Dungeons, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Urns of Chance in Sludge Plains Ruins and the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Dungeon Alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues, Shrines, Cragrock Towers, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

They can also be found as scattered items in Chiromaw Matriarch Nests.
