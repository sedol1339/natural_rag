The **Shockwave Sword** is a powerful unique weapon that can be obtained from the Armory of the Wight Fortress.

There are five variations - The four disassembled pieces of the sword, as well as the sword itself which has a charged and uncharged state.

The Armory room.

Obtaining
-----------

To obtain the Shockwave Sword, players must navigate a floor of Spike Traps through the Fortress' Armory room and break the four Item Cages on the ceiling. This can only be done while standing directly beneath them, indicated by the Glowing Betweenstone Tiles on the floor, either by hand or more quickly by Axe.

Once the cages are broken, the released pieces will float towards the center and form into the finished Sword.

Additionally, the only way to pass the Energy Barriers surrounding the boss portal near the top of the Wight Fortress is by holding the assembled Shockwave Sword when walking through them.

Attacking
-----------

The Shockwave Sword attacks the same as a regular sword, and has the same base damage and attack speed as a Valonite Sword. Like all Betweenlands tools, the Shockwave Sword deals more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools.

However, it also has an additional ability when right-clicked on a block, launching a "shockwave" ~18 blocks in the aimed direction. This shockwave glows with a blue shader effect, briefly lifting most blocks into the air, dealing damage and heavy knockback to any mob it hits.

Note that after every third shockwave, the sword's ability will have a cooldown of ~1.5 seconds. This is visually represented by the sword's red gem flashing blue to indicate the cooldown period.

Repairing
-----------

Like the vanilla Elytra, the Shockwave Sword does not completely break when it reaches 0 durability. Rather, it simply becomes unusable, unable to deal damage or create shockwaves. A damaged sword can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Shockwave Sword** | Damaged **Shockwave Sword** + Sulfur (26-47) + Life Crystal (42-83% charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Shockwave Sword is assembled in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output.

A corroded Shockwave Sword can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Shockwave Sword** | Corroded and uncoated **Shockwave Sword** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Shockwave Sword can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Shockwave Sword** (75 points per piece) | **Shockwave Sword** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Shockwave Sword can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Shockwave Sword** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Shockwave Sword** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Shockwave Sword can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Shockwave Sword** | **Shockwave Sword** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Advancements
--------------

| Advancement | In-game Description | Parent | Actual Requirements | ID |
