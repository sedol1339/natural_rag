The **Predator Bow** is powerful bow obtained in Sludgeon Chests. It is one of the 3 legendary weapons that can be obtained in this dungeon, the others being the Ancient Battle Axe and the Ancient Greatsword.

Fully drawn, the Predator Bow redirects the arrows it fires towards the nearest enemy, allowing arrows to go a bit further.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Predator Bow can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Predator Bow** | Damaged **Predator Bow** + Sulfur (4-6) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Ancient Greatsword is obtained in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using drawing it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its maximum pullback power.

A corroded Predator Bow can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Predator Bow** | Corroded and uncoated **Predator Bow** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Predator Bow can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Predator Bow** (75 points per piece) | **Predator Bow** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Predator Bow can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Predator Bow that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Predator Bow** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Predator Bow** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Predator Bow can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Predator Bow** | **Predator Bow** + Any Middle Gem |  |
