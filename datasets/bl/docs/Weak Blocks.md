**Weak Blocks** are a unique type of trap block found in the 3rd and 5th floors of the Wight Fortress.

Weak Polished Limestone.

They come in three varieties, appearing as heavily cracked versions of Betweenstone Tiles, Mossy Betweenstone Tiles, and Polished Limestone, although each behave the same.

Falling
---------

When walked on by the player, Weak Blocks will begin to fall, breaking and dropping nothing when they hit the ground. Weak Blocks won't fall if there is a block directly below them, and can also be safely walked over when sneaking.

Mobs and other entities will not cause Weak Blocks to fall.

Particles
-----------

Weak Blocks emit subtle black particles below them, similarly to floating vanilla sand or gravel.

Collection
------------

Weak Blocks can be collected with any pickaxe, and are not protected by the Wight Fortress' block protection ward.
