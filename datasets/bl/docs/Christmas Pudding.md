Obtaining
-----------

### Loot
Christmas Pudding can be found as Loot from Presents that generate randomly on the surface of The Betweenlands during the Winter seasonal event.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Christmas Pudding restores 6 hunger and 5.7 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Christmas Pudding has a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time it is eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Christmas Pudding only restores 2 hunger () when eaten, a third of the original hunger value.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.
