Usage
-------

A Water Filter can be filled with any fluid, dripping it down into fluid inventories below it, including other Water Filters. If given a Mesh Strainer, it can filter Swamp Water into Clean Water or Stagnant Water into Swamp Water. Doing so also has a chance to give an assortment of loot which can be received by right-clicking the strainer.
