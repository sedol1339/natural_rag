Behavior
----------

Bubbler Crabs move quickly by walking from side to side. They try to keep their distance, but will attack the player with a snip or shoot a bubble before scurrying away. Bubbles take a short while to pop and deal damage. When a player is hit by a bubble, the bubble will stick to them until just before it pops, allowing the player a short moment to escape.

Bubbler Crabs cannot swim, and instead will simply sink. They do not drown however.

### Catching
Bubbler Crabs can be caught with a Crab Pot. They are used for Filtering recipes or can be released like other caught critters. Keep in mind that they will still be aggressive when released. They can also be turned into 2 Crab Claws and 2 Crabsticks in a Trimming Table.
