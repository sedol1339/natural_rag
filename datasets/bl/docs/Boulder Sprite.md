Description
-------------

Boulder Sprites resemble, as its name suggests, a living boulder - it appears to be made up of mainly Betweenstone. They have thick eyebrows and a large beard made of moss, and small feet that allow them to walk idly (when they are not rolling) as well as yellowish eyes. The most prominent feature is the large nose which is made of a darker material than the rest of the body. Additionally, a Boulder Sprite may spawn with a random number of stalactites on top of its head, which will drop upon death.

Behavior
----------

When alone, a Boulder Sprite will seek to burrow itself into Betweenstone or Pitstone. If they spot a player while burrowed, they can roll out at them. They will also cease their ambient sounds while burrowed.

Attacking Boulder Sprites tend to roll every 6-7 seconds. They can also harm other creatures with their roll, and draw their aggro. The amount of damage a roll will do is determined by the sprite's speed - the faster it is moving, the more damage it will do.

They can destroy blocks they come into contact with during the middle of their roll. Occasionally, they can destroy two block high walls by starting their roll right next to them.

Boulder Sprites will sink and drown in water.

Strategy
----------

Boulder Sprites will roll at where the player just was, so simply circling them will cause them to miss. Standing atop a 3 high pillar will also render them useless, though be aware of the surroundings, as they can still destroy blocks at eye level.

Before drawing aggro, a player can also stand directly on top of them and their roll will not hit from there.

You can also block their rolls with a shield, though it is not too reliable as sometimes a Boulder Sprite will move so fast that it bypasses what the shield can protect, also inflicting a lot of damage to the durability of said shield.

As they are made of stone, a pickaxe is more effective than a sword when fighting one.
