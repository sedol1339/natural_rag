**Tainted Potions** are consumable items that result from bringing non-Betweenlands potions to the Betweenlands. They are meant to encourage using other sources of status effects *from* the Betweenlands.

Obtaining
-----------

### The Betweenlands
While in The Betweenlands, any Potion from other dimensions in the player's inventory (including Splash Potions and Lingering Potions) will instantly turn into a Tainted Potion. The original potion's identity will be retained and displayed in parentheses as part of the item name.

While the potion tainting mechanic is on by default, the mod's config.cfg file can be used to disable or reenable it. The config can also be used to blacklist additional items to turn into Tainted Potions, or whitelist specific items to *not* turn into Tainted Potions.

Items do not become Tainted Potions while in Creative Mode.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When consumed, Tainted Potions inflict the  Poison III effect for 6 seconds, and the  Elixir of Decay IV effect for 9 seconds, which drains the player's decay bar over time.

### Reverting
If a Tainted Potion is returned to a dimension other than The Betweenlands, it will revert back to its original potion item.

Notes
-------

* Similarly to Tainted Potions, most food from outside of The Betweenlands turns into Rotten Food while in the dimension.

History
---------

* Release 3.3.7:
  + Added more config entries for Tainted Potions.
