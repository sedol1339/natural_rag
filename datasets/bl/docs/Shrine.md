A Shrine in a Marsh, spawning Blood Snails

*"These shrines...are found in the most despicably creepy of places. Vast flats of nothing but mud that wants to swallow you and sludge that clings to you, pulling you down...ugh."*

> *-From Explorer's Entries: Dungeon Shrine*

**Shrines** are structures that generate occasionally in Marsh and Sludge Plains biomes. They are small constructs that contain a single central spawner, as well as a single chest with loot.

Shrines have a world location that identifies the area they take up, as well as a title that appears briefly to players who approach them.
