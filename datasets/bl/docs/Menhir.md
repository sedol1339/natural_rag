A Menhir ingame

A linked Menhir

The **Menhir** is a special utility block that generates sparsely anywhere on the surface of The Betweenlands. It can be linked for fast travel.

Naturally generated Menhirs have a world location that identifies the area they take up.

Particles
-----------

Black particles will linger in the area surrounding a Menhir.

How to Use
------------

A Menhir can be linked for fast travel by right-clicking it with an unlinked Bone Wayfinder, which is an item found as loot. Once linked, the Menhir will emit blue particles and change appearance to show it has been marked, and thunder will sound in the distance. Additionally, when the player is close to it, it will emit blue shader light.

From then on, the player can hold down right-click with the linked Bone Wayfinder from anywhere in the Betweenlands to teleport back to the linked Menhir's location.

Note that the Menhir cannot be moved by players in Survival Mode. This means that the location you can fast travel to is limited to where the Menhir originally generated. Additionally, each Bone Wayfinder can only be linked to one Menhir at a time, although multiple different Bone Wayfinders can be linked to the same Menhir. Teleporting with it costs durability and experience and inflicts Blindness II () onto the player for 3 seconds afterwards.

Collection
------------

The Menhir drops nothing when harvested. The block itself cannot be collected in any way, nor can it be destroyed by explosions.
