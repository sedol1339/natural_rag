The Beam Origin ingame

The activated Beam Origin

The **Beam Origin** is a special puzzle block that is found atop of the Sludgeon Tower of the Sludgeon. It is used to activate the beam puzzle that is then used to enter the underground areas of the structure.

Puzzle
--------

The Beam Origin renders as a downwards-pointed pyramid when placed. When first found, it will be in its "inactive" state, when it appears dark. The player and nearby Braziers are mirrored when looking into the origin, and the mirrored Braziers will be lit with fire even if they are not actually lit yet, indicating that they should be lit.

Each Brazier lit will send a small orange shader beam from the fire to the origin. The origin will begin spinning, and it will spin faster the more Braziers are lit. Once all four Braziers are lit, the origin will begin generating a green shader beam directly downwards, and each of the Braziers will spawn an Emberling Shaman.

As long as the Beam Origin remains activated, the green beam it generates can then be directed through Beam Lenses and Beam Passages to the Dungeon Door at the base of the tower, which acts as the main puzzle. The beam can travel up to 14 blocks in one direction without contacting anything before it dissipates. It will also dissipate upon contacting a normal solid block, but is absorbed and redirected by Beam Lenses, and can pass through Beam Lens Supports and properly oriented Beam Passages. The door will open once the beam reaches it, allowing access to the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon.

Note that the Beam Origin will deactivate again if any of the Braziers powering it becomes unlit or is removed.
