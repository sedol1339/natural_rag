Growing
---------

Planted Root Pods will eventually grow into a small formation of Giant Roots. This formation consists of a Root tendril with a base of Giant Root blocks and surrounded by various basic plants such as Swamp Tallgrass, Double Swamp Tallgrass, Cattails, Tall Cattails, and Shoots. The Root Pod's growth can be expedited with Ground Dried Swamp Reed, and it does not require nearly as much space as saplings do.
