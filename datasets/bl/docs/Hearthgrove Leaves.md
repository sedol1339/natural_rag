Hearthgrove Leaves ingame

**Hearthgrove Leaves** are the leaf blocks of Hearthgrove Trees.

Contents

* 1 Particles
* 2 Decay
* 3 Collection
* 4 Compostability
* 5 History

Particles
-----------

Small leaf particles will fall around Hearthgrove Leaves.

Decay
-------

Like other leaves, natural Hearthgrove Leaves spontaneously decay and disappear when they receive a block tick if they are not connected to any living wood block.

Hearthgrove Leaves placed by the player will never naturally decay.

Collection
------------

When decayed or harvested normally, Hearthgrove Leaves usually drop nothing, but have a chance to drop a Hearthgrove Sapling. The leaf blocks themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Compostability
----------------

Hearthgrove Leaves have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 4. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

History
---------
