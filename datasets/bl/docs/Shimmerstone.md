Throwing
----------

The Shimmerstone can be thrown by right-clicking, traveling a relatively far distance and landing as a dropped item. This is useful because it will distract Peat Mummies, who are attracted to dropped Shimmerstones over other targets, allowing the player to get away from them more easily. Note that the Peat Mummy will consume the dropped Shimmerstone after standing for a few seconds over it.

Repeller
----------

The Shimmerstone can also be placed inside a Repeller by right-clicking, which is required for it to function. It can be removed with a shift right-click.

Trivia

* The relationship between the Peat Mummy and the Shimmerstone is a mild reference to Gollum's relationship to the One Ring, or "Precious", in the Lord of the Rings series.
