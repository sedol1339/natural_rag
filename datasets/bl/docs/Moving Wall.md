**Moving Walls** are non-destructible entities that can be found on the seventh and semi-final layer of the Sludgeon and serve as obstacles to the player.

Description
-------------

Moving Walls appear as large 3x3 walls of Mud Bricks that slowly move along a corridor until they collide with another Moving Wall, or with the protected blocks of the dungeon itself. At that point, they will travel back the way they came. Any other breakable block caught in their path will be broken. If the player is caught by a Moving Wall against the dungeon walls or another Moving Wall, they will be dealt five hearts of damage regardless of armor or difficulty.

Moving Walls will disappear when the Sludgeon is cleared.
