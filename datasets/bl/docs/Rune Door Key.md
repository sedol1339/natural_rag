The **Rune Door Key** is an item dropped by a Barrishee when killed by a player.

Description
-------------

The Rune Door Key is a single use key that instantly unlocks any Dungeon Door on use, setting it to the correct combination. It is dropped by a Barrishee when killed by a player.

Rune Door Keys can be especially useful in the seventh layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults, as the Moving Walls can spawn directly in the path of the door, making it difficult to enter the combination normally.

As only one Barrishee spawns in each Sludgeon, and do not respawn after being killed, Rune Door Keys are extremely rare.
