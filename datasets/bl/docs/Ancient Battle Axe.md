The **Ancient Battle Axe** is a powerful and unique weapon that can be obtained in the Barrishee lair room after defeating the Barrishee in the fourth layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults. It is one of the 3 legendary weapons that can be obtained in this dungeon, the others being the Ancient Greatsword and the Predator Bow.

Attacking
-----------

The **Ancient Battle Axe** functions similar to a Valonite Greataxe, it has the same base damage as the Valonite Greataxe, however it strikes a bit quicker at an attack speed of 1 instead of 0.7 found on the Valonite Greataxe. It attacks targets in a sweep attack, dealing 9 damage to all of them and 1 damage to entities further away. When used on wooden blocks, it breaks them in a slow arc in front of the player.

Repairing
-----------

A damaged axe can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Ancient Battle Axe** | Damaged **Ancient Battle Axe** + Sulfur (18-31) + Life Crystal (28-49% Charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Ancient Battle Axe is obtained in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Like with all Betweenlands weapons, corrision decreases its damage output.

A corroded Ancient Battle Axe can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

| Removes the corrosion from **Ancient Battle Axe** | **Ancient Battle Axe** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250mb) |  |

An Ancient Battle Axe can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keeps the corrosion level static until the Scabyst coatings durability is depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coated **Ancient Battle Axe** (75 points per Scabyst) | **Ancient Battle Axe** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Last but not least, a corroded Ancient Battle Axe can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on an Ancient Battle Axe that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Ancient Battle Axe** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Ancient Battle Axe** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Ancient Battle Axe can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The bonuses provided can be seen on the correlating gem.

| Applies Middle Gem to **Ancient Battle Axe** | **Ancient Battle Axe** + Any Middle Gem |  |
