Description
-------------

There are three ways that Stench can be afflicted onto the player:

* Contacting Stagnant Water will afflict Stench.
* Having a rotten Anadia in the inventory, such as by allowing a fresh one to rot there, will afflict Stench.
* Standing in the area-of-effect produced by a Chiromaw Matriarch's droppings will afflict Stench.

### Effects
When a player has Stench, flies will appear to swarm around them, and their Decay will drop faster. Greebling Riders and Lurkers will become aggressive to the player, and Wights will be able to target them even if they are sneaking.

Removal
---------

Stench will leave the player on its own after 20 minutes. It can be removed immediately by using a Fumigant, which can either be applied directly by right-clicking it or in an area using a Censer. It is also removed upon death.
