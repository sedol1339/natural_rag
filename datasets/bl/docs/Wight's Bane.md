Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Wight's Bane** (16 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (12% charge) |  |

Crypt Crawlers
----------------

Some Crypt Crawlers can spawn equipped with a Wight's Bane. The weapon has a chance to drop when the Crypt Crawler is killed.

Attacking
-----------

Against most mobs, the Wight's Bane only deals its minimum base damage; however, it will instantly kill any Wights it is used against, making it very useful. Like all Betweenlands tools, the Wight's Bane deals more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Wight's Bane.

Corrosion
-----------

The Wight's Bane is found in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output.

A corroded Wight's Bane can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Wight's Bane** | Corroded and uncoated **Wight's Bane** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Wight's Bane can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Wight's Bane** (75 points per piece) | **Wight's Bane** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Wight's Bane can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Wight's Bane that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Wight's Bane** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Wight's Bane** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Wight's Bane can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Wight's Bane** | **Wight's Bane** + Any Middle Gem |  |
