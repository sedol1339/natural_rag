Equipping Bark Amulets

The Bark Amulet effect on a few mobs

The **Bark Amulet** is a special item that displays the approximate health of nearby mobs. It is a guaranteed reward for defeating the Large Spirit Tree Face of a Spirit Tree.

How to Equip
--------------

The Bark Amulet can be right-clicked to equip it onto the player in an invisible slot beside the hotbar. The Amulet will be animated while it is equipped. Note that only one Bark Amulet can be equipped at a time.

The Bark Amulet is equipped through the Radial Equipment Menu, which is opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any Bark Amulet equipped onto the player (in red tab) as well as amulets in their inventory (in green tab). A Bark Amulet can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management of amulet equipping.

Effect
--------

When equipped, the Bark Amulet causes rings of glowing, orbiting wisps to appear above nearby mobs in a relatively small radius. These wisps denote the general health that the mob has; at maximum health, each mob has 9 orbiting wisps, but as they take damage the number of wisps decreases. This means that each wisp accounts for about 11% of the mob's total health. This rudimentary damage indicator can make it easier to tell how close a mob is to death.

In addition, the wisps will show above mobs that would otherwise be hidden, including if they are under Invisibility or are hiding inside of blocks (such as Sludges and Boulder Sprites). This makes it less likely for certain mobs to have the surprise advantage on a player, although this does not work to see mobs *through* blocks.
