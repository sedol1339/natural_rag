| **Octine Shield** | Octine Ingot (7) |  |

Blocking
----------

Like any shield, the Octine Shield can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player receives a small amount of knockback upon blocking. The shield can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

The Octine Shield has the unique ability to set any enemies that get blocked by it on fire for 4 seconds.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Octine Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Octine Shield** | Damaged **Octine Shield** + Sulfur (6-12) + Life Crystal (6-25% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Octine Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip, or on the Middle Gem page.
