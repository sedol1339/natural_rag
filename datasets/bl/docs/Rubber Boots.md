Properties

### Stats
When worn, Rubber Boots provide 1 armor point, or 0.5 armor icons, and absorb up to 4% of damage from the player at the expense of durability. They prevent the player from getting stuck in Mud, allowing them to walk over it normally, except if they are under the effects of a Heavyweight Draught. They also negate the slowing effects caused by walking on Fallen Leaves, Peat, and Silt - however, they will *not* negate the slowing effects of Sludge or Sludgy Dirt.

Rubber Boots also provide immunity to being damaged by chaining electric shocks as a result of using items such as Shock Arrows and the Chirobarb Shock Erupter, or the attacks of Tamed Lightning Chiromaws. However, when preventing shock damage, the player will instead be inflicted with the  Shocked effect for 1.5 seconds, preventing them from moving. Damage from Lightning is *not* prevented.

The Boots of the Marsh Runner are an improved variant of Rubber Boots that, in addition to the above, will allow the player to walk on top of Swamp Water for about 1-2 seconds. The speed at which the player can walk on the water will decrease the longer they are on it. This effect can be canceled by pressing shift while it is active.

### Repairing
Like most other equipment with durability, both types of damaged Rubber Boots can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Rubber Boots** | Any damaged **Rubber Boots** + Sulfur (4-8) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

### Middle Gems
As with most equipment, both types of Rubber Boots can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player wearing them. The type of gem equipped can be seen in their tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to corresponding **Rubber Boots** | Any **Rubber Boots** + Any Middle Gem |  |

### Corrosion
Both types of Rubber Boots do not corrode.

### Lyestone
Like with all Boots, stepping on Lyestone while wearing either type of Rubber Boots will cause them to start corroding other blocks that the player stands on over time while worn, which makes them occasionally fall if they are not supported by another block below. This corroding effect can be removed from the boots by entering Swamp Water or vanilla Water for a few seconds while wearing them.
