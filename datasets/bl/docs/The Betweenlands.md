Lore
------

During the time when the light in The Overworld had just begun to shine and the flames of The Nether had just begun to burn, there existed a dimension which is little other than a void of nothingness. But out of nowhere, a giant inter-dimensional rift appeared and energy seeped into it, giving it potential for life to populate and grow in this dimension. A race of NPCs inhabited it, including a powerful Druid. He and his followers worked to twist the Nether's evil into a weapon of peace. However, when they opened the portal in this dimension, evil surged out into it. This caused the NPCs to become Wights. The Druid himself became the Prime Wight, and he now wielded power over this dimension. He caused the Betweenlands to become a swampy, deathly land, as it is now. After much time, a traveler (the player) found their way to the dimension.

Features
----------

The Betweenlands is so foul that Players will decay simply by living in it. The dimension has no daylight cycle of its own, although it experiences some effects from the Overworld's daylight cycle through the periodic Rift event. Additionally, several blocks and items from the Overworld are nullified:

* Clocks and Compasses spin wildly, unable to function in any useful way; whereas Beds, Bone Meal, and Flint and Steel do not function at all.
* Torches from other dimensions become Damp Torches, so alternative light sources, like Sulfur Torches, must be used instead.
* Due to the warm and wet environment of The Betweenlands, food from other dimensions rots when traveling through the portal, becoming Rotten Food. Similarly, Potions from other dimensions will become Tainted Potions.

Tools and weapons from other dimensions are much less effective in the Betweenlands, prompting the player to use the Betweenlands tools. However, Betweenlands tools in your inventory gradually undergo Corrosion, which is a process that causes the tools to become less effective.

Players also suffer from Food Sickness when eating the same food too often, causing it to become less filling.

As Flint and Steel doesn't work in the dimension, players need to use alternate methods to make fire. Simply hold right-click on Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, or Thorns (either placed as a block or dropped as an item) with an Octine Ingot to light it on fire. The plant will slowly build up flame until it turns into a fire block, without consuming the ingot in the process. This is essential for getting an Infuser started.

Ground Dried Swamp Reed must be used in place of Bone Meal to fertilize plants and crops in the Betweenlands.

Players must use Moss Beds in place of normal Beds to set their spawn point in the Betweenlands. However, since there is no proper daylight cycle, players cannot sleep in Moss Beds to skip any "night", not even through the Rift event.

How to Access
---------------

The Betweenlands can be accessed by creating a Portal Tree, which contains four portals to the dimension. For more information on how to access the dimension, visit the How to get there page.

The Betweenlands' sky

Environment
-------------

A tunnel leading into a small Limestone Cave, with Thorns growing on the side.

The Betweenlands is a dark, swamp-themed dimension.

The sky is usually an animated green patchwork of mysterious, hazy stars, although these are often covered by the dimension's various weather Events, like Auroras, Heavy Rain, Fog, etc, along with other much more dangerous ones.

The dimension is composed of many biomes. Swamplands, Patchy Islands, Coarse Islands, Sludge Plains, Deep Waters, Marshes and even some sub-biomes. These biomes are crawling with very thick, uncontrolled flora and fauna, and many ruins of long lost civilizations, among other mysterious structures. The Betweenlands also contains several dungeons which can then be explored to get loot or to fight bosses. As the Betweenlands is still in development, it may introduce some new biomes in the future with many more structures and mobs.

The Lake Caverns, or Pitstone layer of The Betweenlands. It houses Valonite Ore, and Life Crystal Ore.

The Betweenlands features many trees and wood types. Small Weedwood Trees are often most ubiquitous, although there are also many other variations. Sap Trees, Rubber Trees, Hearthgrove Trees, Nibbletwig Trees, Hollow Logs, and Giant Roots, as well as the rare Spirit Tree boss.

### Caves
Sea level in the Betweenlands is y=121, meaning caves in the dimension are much deeper. They are also very dark, with a black fog completely covering anything too far away from the player. Betweenlands caves are also split up into two layers, the upper Caverns and the lower Lake Caverns, each with different resources available. The caves themselves are often wide, interconnected, and filled with underground flora and dripping stalactites, along with echoing cave ambiance and occasional hostile mobs.

The dimension has many ores, such as Sulfur Ore, Slimy Bone Ore, Octine Ore, Syrmorite Ore, Valonite Ore, and Life Crystal Ore.

Caves are also interspersed with occasional structures you can explore.
