Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lurker Skin Shield** | Lurker Skin (6) + Weedwood Stick |  |

Blocking
----------

Like any shield, the Lurker Skin Shield can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player receives a small amount of knockback upon blocking. The shield can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

Rafting
---------

In addition to functioning as a shield, the Lurker Skin Shield can also be used as a raft. Right-clicking water while holding a Lurker Skin Shield will place the shield down and automatically seat the player on it, making it useful for a quick escape. Shift right-clicking with the shield allows it to be placed without entering it, after which it can be mounted manually with another right-click.

The Lurker Skin Raft controls identically to the vanilla Boat, using the normal directional keys to move and turn and preventing the player from looking directly behind themselves. The raft has an advantage over the Weedwood Rowboat in that it is easier to deploy and control; however, it is slower and does not protect against attacks by mobs from below. It also cannot be used as a shield in this form. It is worth noting that the Lurker Skin Armor bonus gives faster movement speed underwater than the raft.

Pressing shift while on the Lurker Skin Raft will dismount the player, automatically picking the raft up and equipping it in the player's offhand slot. If the slot is occupied, it will attempt to put the shield in a regular inventory slot; if there is no space, it will not be picked up upon dismounting. A free-standing raft can be broken and collected back as a shield by punching it a few times.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Lurker Skin Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Lurker Skin Shield** | Damaged **Lurker Skin Shield** + Sulfur (5-10) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Lurker Skin Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Lurker Skin Shield** | **Lurker Skin Shield** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Lurker Skin Shield does not corrode.
