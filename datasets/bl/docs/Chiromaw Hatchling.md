**Chiromaw Hatchlings** are giant egg entities that hatch into Chiromaws. While some of them are wild and cannot be retrieved, others can be collected, hatched, and fed to be raised into Tamed Chiromaws.

Spawning
----------

Chiromaw Hatchlings spawn in Chiromaw Matriarch Nests on Raised Islands in Raised Isles biomes, often guarded by a Chiromaw Matriarch.

### Respawning
If a Chiromaw Hatchling is removed from its nest and its Chiromaw Matriarch is killed, one will eventually respawn along with the matriarch as long as no player has stood on the center block of the nest; otherwise, it will not respawn.

Properties
------------

### Wild Hatchlings
When initially found in Chiromaw Matriarch Nests, Chiromaw Hatchlings have a chance to be wild. A wild Chiromaw Hatchling will immediately hatch into an untamed Chiromaw when a player approaches it, and cannot be collected for raising.

### Catching
Non-wild Chiromaw Hatchlings can be right-clicked with a Net to capture them as an inventory item. This item can then be right-clicked on the ground to release the Chiromaw Hatchling as an entity there.

Usage
-------

### Raising
Raising a Chiromaw Hatchling requires a lengthy process of hatching and feeding before being eventually tamed. Note that it can be killed, causing it to drop nothing, so it is important to keep it safe.

#### Hatching
Non-wild Chiromaw Hatchlings need to be placed on top of a Block of Octine for 10 minutes in order to hatch into juveniles. Their incubation progress is saved when they are picked up with a Net. The more they move, the closer they are to hatching. Once they are hatched, they cannot be put into the inventory until they are fully grown.

#### Feeding
When they hatch, Chiromaw Hatchling juveniles will immediately be hungry and cry when they see a player, with an image of a food over their heads showing what the player needs to bring them. The feeding items that juveniles can desire are derived from the chiromaw\_hatchling loot table.

The following is a list of all of the feeding items that can be desired by Chiromaw Hatchling juveniles, including their rolls, quantities, and weights.

| **Chiromaw Hatchling** Feeding Items | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feeding Item** | **Quantity** | **Weight** |
| 2 Rolls: | | |
| **Raw Anadia Meat** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Silt Crab Claw** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Dragonfly (item)** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Dragonfly Wing** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Firefly (item)** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Raw Frog's Leg** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Gecko (item)** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Lurker Skin** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Mire Snail Egg (item)** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |
| **Raw Snail Flesh** | 1 | 1/10 (10%) |

Visit the Loot Tables page for more information on loot.

When a Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile becomes hungry again, it will make a different set of noises, only crying when it sees a player. Notably, a juvenile will not see you if you are standing a block above them, so you can feed it with less crying.

#### Lightning Effects
If a Chiromaw Hatchling is struck by Betweenlands Lightning, it will become a **Lightning Chiromaw Hatchling** and begin emitting lightning effects. It is better to do this before they hatch, as you can still put them in your inventory before then. Feeding them after they hatch is the same as usual.

#### Taming
Once a Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile has been fed 8 times, it will fully grow into a Tamed Chiromaw. If it was a Lightning Chiromaw Hatchling, it will instead grow into a Tamed Lightning Chiromaw.
