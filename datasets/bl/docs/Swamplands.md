**Swamplands** are Betweenlands biomes characterized by large amounts of somewhat flat, dry land filled with relatively densely packed Weedwood, Nibbletwig, Rubber, and Sap Trees, high amounts of ground foliage, and occasional cave entrances breaking the surface. They have the largest land-to-water ratio of any biome in the Betweenlands, with occasional rivers of Swamp Water breaking up the land.

Swamplands have a **Clearing** sub-biome which can rarely spawn in small areas within normal Swamplands biomes, surrounded by Swamp Water.

Sub-Biomes

### Swamplands Clearing
Map Color

The Swamplands Clearing landscape

The **Swamplands Clearing** sub-biome contains a single, relatively flat island made purely of grass, with no normal trees and almost no foliage in comparison to the regular Swamplands biome. A Spirit Tree will always spawn in the center of this sub-biome, with its roots dug in throughout the island.

After the Spirit Tree in a Swamplands Clearing has been defeated, the grass of the Clearing will slowly convert into Spreading Sludgy Dirt. The sub-biome will eventually become similar to a miniature Sludge Plains biome, capable of spawning Sludges and Smol Sludges.
