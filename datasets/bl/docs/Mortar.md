How to Use
------------

The Mortar's interface can be accessed with right-click. Grinding requires the following items:

* A Pestle, which must be right-clicked into the Mortar or manually placed into the middle slot. For each item ground, the Pestle will lose 1 durability, and eventually break and need to be replaced.
* The item that is to be ground, placed in the left slot.

With these requirements met, the Mortar can be left-clicked to grind one item. A progress bar will show how much time is left, taking about 4 seconds to complete, with the Pestle visually spinning, finishing with a couple taps and a crunching sound.

The Mortar must be left-clicked once for each item ground. However, this process can be automated with a charged Life Crystal or Life Crystal Fragment, which can either be right-clicked directly into the Mortar or placed manually into the upper slot of the interface. The Life Crystal will then grind as many items as it can, draining 0-1% of its charge with each item.

The resulting item/s can be retrieved from the right slot of the interface.
