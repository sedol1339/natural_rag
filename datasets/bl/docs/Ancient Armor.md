A full set of Ancient Armor grants 20 armor points, or 10 armor icons. It also grants up to half magic damage reduction and is unbreakable (unusable at 0 durability until repaired.)

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, any damaged piece of **Ancient Armor** can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Fully repairs corresponding **Ancient Armor** piece. | Any damaged **Ancient Armor** piece + Sulfur (8-25) + Life Crystal (15-37% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, all pieces of **Ancient Armor** can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player wearing them. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the armor as well as in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
