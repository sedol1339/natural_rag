Crafting Recipes
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blank Amate Paper Lantern | Weedwood Plank Slab (3) + Any Amate Paper Pane (2) + Firefly (item) + Weedwood Planks (3) |  |
| Switches Amate Paper Lantern variant | Amate Paper Lantern |  |
| Silt Glass Lantern | Weedwood Plank Slab (3) + Silt Glass Pane (2) + Firefly (item) + Weedwood Planks (3) |  |

Placement
-----------

Lanterns can only be placed on the top and bottom of most blocks, and are hung by a rope if placed on an underside. Breaking the block a Lantern is sitting on or attached to will cause the lantern to break as well. Unlike Sulfur Torches, they can be oriented in 8 different directions and can be placed underwater. They can also be placed at the end of Climbing Rope.

Particles
-----------

Small particles resembling flies and moths will occasionally float around Amate Paper Lanterns. Silt Glass Lanterns contain glowing particles resembling fireflies inside of them.

Providing Light
-----------------

Lanterns provide a light level of 15, which is slightly more light than both vanilla Torches and Sulfur Torches. Additionally, unlike Sulfur Torches, they do not become extinguished when exposed to rain from the Heavy Rain event, making them a more permanent alternative.
