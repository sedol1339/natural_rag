Behavior
----------

Greebling Coracles are passive mobs that paddle across the water. They stay away from the player and vanish when they get too close, leaving their coracle behind. The coracle can be looted by right clicking it. After at most 3 clicks or a few moments, the coracle will sink. Projectiles will bounce off Greebling Coracles but still cause them to vanish.
