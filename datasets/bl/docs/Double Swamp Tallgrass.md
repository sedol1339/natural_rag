Collection
------------

Double Swamp Tallgrass must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Swamp Tallgrass Blades, which can then be ground into Ground Swamp Tallgrass.

Growing
---------

Double Swamp Tallgrass will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Double Swamp Tallgrass has a compost process time of 8 minutes and 20 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Double Swamp Tallgrass will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
