| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Bone Chestplate | Slimy Bone (8) |  |
| Bone Leggings | Slimy Bone (7) |  |

Stats
-------

A full set of Bone Armor provides 11 armor points, or 5.5 armor icons, and absorbs 44% of damage from the player at the expense of durability. There are no set bonuses from a full set of Bone Armor.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, any damaged piece of Bone Armor can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Bone Armor** piece | Any damaged **Bone Armor** piece + Sulfur (4-8) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, any piece of Bone Armor can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player wearing them. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the armor as well as in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to corresponding **Bone Armor** piece | Any **Bone Armor** piece + Any Middle Gem |  |

Corrosion
-----------

Bone Armor does not corrode.
