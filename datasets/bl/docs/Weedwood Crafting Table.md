Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Weedwood Crafting Table** | Weedwood Planks (4) |  |

How to Use
------------

The crafting interface can be accessed by right-clicking the Weedwood Crafting Table. Crafting works nearly identically to crafting in a vanilla Crafting Table, featuring the usual three-by-three grid, output slot, and recipe book option. However, unlike the vanilla Crafting Table, the Weedwood Crafting Table will keep items inside its interface even when no players are using it. These items will also be rendered visibly on top of the table, arranged in the same fashion as they are in the crafting grid.

Due to how Corrosion in the Betweenlands works, corrodable items that are inside any storage container, including a Weedwood Crafting Table, will stop corroding, only resuming if they are taken out of the table.
