Aspect Vials ingame

**Aspect Vials** are items created by distilling an Infusion Bucket with a non-valid combination of Aspects (or a valid combination collected at the incorrect time) within an Alembic. They are collected with either type of Dentrothyst Vial.

Aspect Vials each have a single Aspect which they are named off of applied to them, and the type/s obtained from the bucket depend on the aspect ingredients within that bucket. They will also take on a specific liquid color depending on the type of aspect within. Each bucket will yield one Aspect Vial per aspect present, the amount of aspect in each depending on how much was in the initial bucket but reduced from the original amount. Because Ground Items often times have multiple Aspects tied to them which may interfere with making the correct Infusions, this serves as a way of separating those aspects for proper use (if necessary).

Infusing
----------

Aspect Vials can be used, alternatively to Ground Items, as ingredients within the Infuser to create Infusions. The total decimal amount of the Aspects determines how many Infusions are made from a resulting Infusion Bucket. The ratio of certain Aspects determines the potency and duration of the Infusions; which Aspects these are depends on the type of Infusion.

Placement and Transferring
----------------------------

Aspect Vials can be placed on the ground with a shift right-click, allowing one to store aspects. Placed vials can be filled by right-clicking on them with Aspect Vials of the same type; each click transfers approximately 0.1 of the item vial's amount into the placed vial, and each vial can store up to 5.0 of the same aspect. Similarly, shift right-clicking on a filled vial with empty Dentrothyst Vials will transfer approximately 0.1 amount of the aspect from the placed vial to the item vial. These vials can be broken and collected again, containing the amount of the aspect that was placed inside.

Placed Aspect Vials have a random position offset, which can be toggled on and off by shift right-clicking on the placed vial with an empty hand.

Aspect Farming
----------------

Aspect Vials can also be applied to planted Aspectrus Plants by pressing the 'use' key on them with the vial to infuse them with the corresponding aspect. The Aspectrus Plant will then begin growing and at full undecayed maturity will produce Aspectrus Fruit and more Aspectrus Seeds containing the same aspect. Each resulting Aspectrus Fruit will contain half of the aspect amount of the Aspect Vial used to grow the plant; whereas the resulting Aspectrus Seeds will contain the same amount as the Aspect Vial did, but subtracted by approximately 0.18.

Repeller
----------

Byariis Aspect Vials can be used as fuel for the Repeller.

Crafting Uses
---------------

In crafting, Aspect Vials require a specific decimal amount in the recipe, subtracting the required amount from the total amount rather than entirely consuming the vial.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corresponding Dentrothyst Vial | Any **Aspect Vial** |  |
| Boots of the Marsh Runner | Byrginaz **Aspect Vial** (1.0) + Rubber Boots |  |
| Mummy Bait | Armaniis **Aspect Vial** (1.0) + Animated Tar Beast Heart + Shimmerstone + Sludge Ball |  |

Notes
-------

* Technically, Aspect Vials of the same type can be combined by using the Infuser and distilling the resulting Infusion Bucket in an Alembic. However, this is more time-consuming and costly compared to simply placing and transferring the vials.
