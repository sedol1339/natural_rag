# The Nether

The Nether

The Nether is a cavernous, almost barren realm of fire and dark magic.

Lore
------

According to legend, a powerful Druid attempted to modify the magic of this place in order to wield it for good. When he and his followers lit a Nether portal in The Betweenlands dimension, the Nether's evil poured out into it. This hellish power transformed its residents into Wights, and the Druid himself became the Prime Wight. The resulting ruined swampland world is what we see ingame.
