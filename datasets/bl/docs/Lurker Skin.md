Obtaining
-----------

### Water Filtering
Lurker Skin can be obtained from filtering Swamp Water with a Mesh Strainer in the Water Filter.

### Drops
Lurker Skin drops from Lurkers upon death if killed by a player, and can drop uncommonly from Crypt Crawlers upon death.

It can also drop from looting Greebling Corpses and Greebling Coracles.

### Loot
Lurker Skin can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underwater Ruins, Underground Ruins, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues, Shrines, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Lurker Skin has a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, it can be right-clicked onto the juvenile to feed it.

### Upgrading
Lurker Skin can be used as an upgrade for the Amphibious Chestplate or Amphibious Leggings by shift right-clicking the armor piece and placing the item in one or more of its upgrade slots (up to 3 can be placed in each slot). Each slot with a Lurker Skin upgrade causes the armor piece to provide a stacking knockback resistance attribute value of 0.25 when equipped.

Each Lurker Skin item at the top of an upgrade stack will receive durability damage when the armor itself is damaged, and will retain this durability loss even if taken out of the armor, becoming unstackable with other Lurker Skin items. Each item has a maximum durability of 64 before breaking, and the armor will then start using the next item down if it was stacked.
