**Winter** is a Christmas-themed seasonal event. It changes a variety of aesthetic elements and some gameplay elements in The Betweenlands.

The Winter event only occurs naturally in the Betweenlands during the last week of December in real time, and will go away afterwards. It is constantly active during this time, unless turned off manually.

Effects
---------

When the Winter event first starts, text will appear above the player's HUD, saying "You hear the sound of sleigh bells in the distance..."

While the Winter event is active, a variety of natural blocks' textures change when placed to a frostier looking theme. For example, many plants and trees will turn pale blue or white colors and will have partially frozen.

The following blocks' textures will change:

* Aqua Middle Gem Ore
* Black Hat Mushroom, Broomsedge
* Cattail, Crimson Middle Gem Ore
* Dead Grass, Double Swamp Tallgrass
* Fallen Leaves, Flathead Mushroom, Flowered Nettle
* Green Middle Gem Ore
* Hanger
* Moss, Mossy Cragrock Bottom, Mossy Cragrock Top, Mud
* Nettle
* Peat, Phragmites, Poison Ivy
* Rubber Tree Leaves, Rubber Tree Log
* Sap Tree Leaves, Seeded Hanger, Shelf Fungus, Silt, Sludge (block), Sludgy Dirt, Smoldering Peat, Soft Rush, Swamp Grass, Swamp Plant, Swamp Reed, Swamp Tallgrass
* Tall Cattail
* Volarpad
* Weedwood Leaves, Weedwood Log

Wights will also take on a new, Santa-based texture.

In addition to the texture changes, the sky will turn a foggy white color, and the normal ambient sounds for the surface of the dimension will be replaced by an alternative Winter-themed ambient track.

Several gameplay changes will also occur during the Winter event:

* Swamp Water will slowly freeze over from land edges without enough light, turning into Black Ice. This will eventually melt back into Swamp Water when a light source is placed near it, or after the event ends.
* Presents will generate randomly over time throughout the surface landscape, which can contain unique goodies. These will disappear over time after the event ends.
* Baubles will generate randomly over time under leaves, such as in trees, and drop experience when broken. These will disappear over time after the event ends.
* Most neutral and hostile mobs from the Betweenlands will have a chance to drop Mince Pies if killed by a player.
* The Heavy Rain event, and by extension the Thunderstorm sub-event, cannot occur while this event is also occurring.
* The Auroras event can only *start* naturally during this event *or* the Rift event. Note that it can remain active after Winter has ended.

### Sub-Event
The Snowfall sub-event can only occur while the Winter event is also occurring. This accompanies the Winter effects with snowfall that generates snow layers.

### Manual Control
The Winter event can be manually turned/toggled on and off using the following command:

```
/blevent <toggle|on|off> thebetweenlands:winter
```
