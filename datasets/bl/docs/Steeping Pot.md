| Steeping Pot | Mud Brick (3) + Reed Rope + Slimy Bone (2) + Smooth Cragrock Slab (3) |  |

Usage
-------

The Steeping Pot requires a heat source such as Smoldering Peat to function. Place the ingredients in a clean Silk Bundle before placing the bundle into the pot, and filling it with a bucket of the liquid specified by the Steeping recipe. It takes 40 seconds to complete a recipe. If the recipe is correct, the fluid color will gradually shift to the output brew. Colored steam will signal when the brew is done. It can then be taken from the pot with either a bucket or 4 Weedwood Bowls. A Dirty Silk Bundle is left behind, and must be purified before being reused.

If a recipe is incorrect, the fluid will evaporate and a Dirty Silk Bundle will be returned.
