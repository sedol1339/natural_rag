Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Sap Spit can drop from Small Spirit Tree Faces upon death.

### Feeding
Sap Spit is produced upon feeding Compost to a *friendly* Small Spirit Tree Face.

Uses
------

### Breeding
Sap Spit can be right-clicked on a Mire Snail to feed it, causing it to enter breeding mode. Two Mire Snails in breeding mode will come together and produce a Mire Snail Egg, which can either be picked up for other purposes or allowed to fully grow into another Mire Snail.

Sludge Balls are an alternative item that can breed Mire Snails.

### Healing
Sap Spit can be right-clicked on a Gecko to feed it, healing it back to full health. This can be done directly on a free Gecko or one that is inside a Gecko Cage. This is useful for preserving Geckos in Gecko testing.

### Upgrading
Sap Spit can be used as an upgrade for any piece of Amphibious Armor by shift right-clicking the armor piece and placing the item in one or more of its upgrade slots (up to 3 can be placed in each slot). Having a slot with a Sap Spit upgrade causes the armor piece to reduce the rate at which Decay *naturally* decreases by 25%. Each additional armor piece with a Sap Spit upgrade equipped decreases the rate of decay loss by another 25%.

Each Sap Spit item at the top of an upgrade stack will receive durability damage when the armor itself is damaged, and will retain this durability loss even if taken out of the armor, becoming unstackable with other Sap Spit items. Each item has a maximum durability of 64 before breaking, and the armor will then start using the next item down if it was stacked.

### Crafting Uses
#### Removing Corrosion
Sap Spit can be used to directly remove Corrosion from any Betweenlands Tools and Weapons affected by it (encompassing Shovels, Pickaxes, Axes, Swords and other melee weapons, Bows, the Simple Slingshot, and the Sickle).

Each item of Sap Spit applied to the equipment removes 85 Corrosion points from it, and any number between 1 and 8 can be crafted with the equipment at once. This can be done on equipment that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from corresponding Tool or Weapon (85 points per item) | Any corroded Tool or Weapon + **Sap Spit** (1-8) |  |

#### Modifying Fish Bait
Sap Spit can be used to decrease the range of a Fish Bait, if it is not already 0. Each Sap Spit applied to the bait decreases its range by 1 (0.5 blocks in every direction), down to a minimum of 0. Any number between 1 and 8 can be crafted with the bait at once (as long as the resulting range is not lower than 0), and it can be optionally crafted in combination with any number of other items that modify the bait.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subtracts range from Fish Bait (-1 per piece) | Shapeless: **Sap Spit** (1-8) + Fish Bait + Other modifier items (0-7) |  |

### Steeping Uses
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pear Cordial (fluid) (1000 mB) | Silk Bundle (containing **Sap Spit** + White Pear + Sludge Ball) + Clean Water (1000 mB) |  |

### Infusing
Sap Spit has Aspects tied to it, which means it can be used to make Infusions within the Infuser. Uniquely, Sap Spit always contains just Ordaniis and Yeowynn, the exact Aspects needed to make an Elixir of Healing. However, the aspects will still not be displayed on the item until it is tested through Gecko testing.
