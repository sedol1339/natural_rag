Effects
---------

Dense Fog in a Marsh biome, with a silhouette

During the Dense Fog event, the thickness of the fog in the dimension will increase significantly, reducing how far the player can see in every direction. Fog during the event will also be much lighter and the slowly drifting, cloudy effect it creates on the horizon will be more noticeable. Many visuals in the sky of the dimension, such as stars and even the Rift, will fade completely out of visibility. The normal ambient sounds for the surface of the dimension will be replaced by an alternative, ghostly ambient track.

A small distance away from the player, distorted, staring silhouettes simply referred to as "**Them**" will occasionally appear. They will seem to float slowly towards the player, but disappear when they get too close. They are purely aesthetic.

In Marsh biomes, fog during the event will become even thicker and lighter than in other biomes, sometimes reducing visibility down to only a few blocks, and "They" will appear more frequently.

A certain Simulacrum effect will only activate while this event is active.

### Prediction
The Wind Chime forecast visual for the Dense Fog event

The Dense Fog event can be predicted up to 5 minutes before it starts by a Wind Chime, or up to 10 minutes before if it is attuned to the event.

When forecasting, a forecast visual will emanate from the Wind Chime, and a unique chime jingle sound will play:
