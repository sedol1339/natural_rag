Properties

### Consuming
When eaten, Nibblesticks restore 1 hunger and 0.1 saturation. They also grant 0-3 XP to the player.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Nibblesticks have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Nibblesticks have a 25% chance to restore 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all. They will also no longer grant experience.

Nibblesticks are particularly susceptible to food sickness - if they grant 1 or more experience when eaten, the food sickness level will increase by 9 instead of 5. They are also affected by food sickness even outside of the Betweenlands dimension.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.
