Composition
-------------

Rubber Trees consist of:

* Rubber Tree Log, as the log block
* Rubber Tree Leaves, as the leaf block

Growing
---------

Rubber Trees can be grown with Rubber Tree Saplings.

Tapping
---------

Rubber Trees are particularly useful because their trunks can be tapped for liquid Rubber by right-clicking on them with any Bucket. Once the bucket is filled, the rubber can be collected from the tree and smelted to yield Rubber Balls. Note that a Rubber Tree Log that has been mined from the tree and replaced cannot be tapped; the log must be a part of the original tree.

See the Rubber Tree Log or Buckets pages for more information.
