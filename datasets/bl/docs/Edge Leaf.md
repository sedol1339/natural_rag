Placement
-----------

Edge Leaves can only be placed between the top and the side of two blocks, lying on the edge they create.

Coloration
------------

Edge Leaves take on different grass colors depending on what biome they are in. The grass color is:

* #48B518 if in the inventory
* #6BC44E in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #627017 in Marsh biomes
* #1FC66D to  #1FC63D in Patchy Islands biomes
* #5B3522 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #2AFF00 to  #50A040 in Swamplands biomes

Collection
------------

Edge Leaves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop an Edge Leaf (item), which can then be ground into Ground Edge Leaf.

Growing
---------

Edge Leaves will grow to adjacent plant-supporting edges between blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. Like other Sludgeon plants, they must also be placed in the range of an active Censer that is being sourced with Bottled Fog in order to grow. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Edge Leaves can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Edge Leaves have a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 8. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
