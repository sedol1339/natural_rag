Collection
------------

Mire Coral must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops a Mire Coral (item), which can then be ground into Ground Mire Coral.

Growing
---------

Mire Coral will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when underwater and on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Mire Coral has a compost process time of 7 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
