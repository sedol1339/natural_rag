Obtaining
-----------

### Filtering Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sludge Ball** | Using Silt Crab: Ball of Sap + Anadia Remains |  |

### Water Filtering
Sludge Balls can be obtained from filtering Swamp Water with a Mesh Strainer in the Water Filter.

### Drops
Sludge Balls drop from breaking Sludge blocks with any shovel.

They can also drop from Sludges, Smol Sludges, Small Sludge Worms, and Large Sludge Worms upon death.

### Loot
Sludge Balls can be found as Loot from:

* Urns of Chance in the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Dungeon Alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon.

Uses
------

### Breeding
Sludge Balls can be right-clicked on a Mire Snail to feed it, causing it to enter breeding mode. Two Mire Snails in breeding mode will come together and produce a Mire Snail Egg, which can either be picked up for other purposes or allowed to fully grow into another Mire Snail.

Sap Spit is an alternative item that can breed Mire Snails.

### Crafting Uses
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corresponding Sludgy Mud Bricks | Shapeless: **Sludge Ball** + Mud Bricks or Sludgy Mud Bricks 1 or Sludgy Mud Bricks 2 or Sludgy Mud Bricks 3 |  |
| Glowing Goop (item) (4) | Shapeless: **Sludge Ball** + Ground Bulb-Capped Mushroom |  |
| Mummy Bait | Shapeless: **Sludge Ball** + Shimmerstone + Animated Tar Beast Heart + Aspect Vial - Armaniis (1.0) |  |

#### Modifying Fish Bait
Sludge Balls can be used to remove the Glowing effect from a Fish Bait, if it was previously glowing. Any number between 1 and 8 can be crafted with the bait at once (although using more than 1 has no additional effect), and it can be optionally crafted in combination with any number of other items that modify the bait (except for Ground Bulb-Capped Mushroom, which re-adds the Glowing effect).

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

| Removes Glowing from Fish Bait | Shapeless: **Sludge Ball** (1-8) + Fish Bait (Glowing) + Other modifier items (0-7) |  |
