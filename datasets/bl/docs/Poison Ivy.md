Placement
-----------

Poison Ivy can only be placed on the side of most blocks. Breaking a higher part of the Poison Ivy vine will break all parts below it that are not connected to a side block as well.

Growth
--------

Poison Ivy naturally grows down from blocks like Vines, and does not require additional side blocks to do so.

Coloration
------------

Poison Ivy takes on different foliage colors depending on what biome it is in. The foliage color is:

* #48B518 if in the inventory
* #A8A800 to  #A87800 in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #63B581 in Marsh biomes
* #00AD7C in Patchy Islands biomes
* #D36423 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #52AF5A to  #85AF51 in Swamplands biomes
* #52AF5A in Swamplands Clearing biomes

Poisoning
-----------

A player or non-Betweenlands mob will receive Poison II () for 3 seconds at random intervals while being in direct contact with Poison Ivy. This poison can be negated with a Toughskin Elixir.

Betweenlands mobs do not receive Poison from Poison Ivy.

Collection
------------

Poison Ivy must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Poison Ivy Leaves, which can then be ground into Ground Poison Ivy.

Compostability
----------------

Poison Ivy has a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Poison Ivy will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
