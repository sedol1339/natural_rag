The three regular Pots of Chance

Tar Pots of Chance at the bottom of a Tar Pool Dungeon

**Pots of Chance** are special blocks that can be found scattered in Caverns and Lake Caverns, as well as in Marsh Ruins, Underground Ruins, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress. There are three different visual variants, each of which has a tar and mud variant that can only be found at specific locations. The tar variant can be found at the bottom of the tar pools in Tar Pool Dungeons. The Mud variant can be found in underwater ruins.

Collecting Loot
-----------------

Each Pot of Chance will drop one or more items from a location-based loot table when broken. Be careful, as there is a chance that an urn will also spawn a small Termite when broken by the player, which will proceed to attack. If a Swamp Water or water block is above the pot, it will spawn a Silt Crab or Bubbler Crab instead. Items can also be extracted one by one with a shift right click. Items can also be stored by right clicking the pot with the desired item. A pot can store up to 3 stacks of items.

Note that regular Pots of Chance can be broken by hand but are most effectively broken with a pickaxe. However, Tar Pots of Chance require a pickaxe to be broken.

Loot
------

The loot in Pots of Chance is derived from six loot tables:

* cave\_pot is used by pots in Caverns and Lake Caverns.
* marsh\_ruins\_pot is used by pots in Marsh Ruins.
* underground\_ruins\_pot is used by pots in Underground Ruins.
* tar\_pool\_pot is used by tar pots in Tar Pool Dungeons.
* cragrock\_tower\_pot is used by pots in Cragrock Towers.
* wight\_fortress\_pot is used by pots in the Wight Fortress.
* underwater\_ruins is used by pots in Underground Ruins.

Visit the Loot Tables page for the contents of these loot tables.

The Pots of Chance themselves cannot be collected in any way.
