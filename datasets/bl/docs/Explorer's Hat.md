Stats
-------

When worn, the Explorer's Hat provides 1 armour point, or 0.5 armour icons, and absorbs 4% of damage from the player at the expense of durability. It is otherwise aesthetic.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Explorer's Hat can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.
