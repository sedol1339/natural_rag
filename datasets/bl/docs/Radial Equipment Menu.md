Description
-------------

Certain items found or crafted in the Betweenlands (mainly rings or Amulets) have an 'equippable' tooltip on them, meaning they can be equipped as part of the Radial Equipment Menu. When an equippable item is in the Player's inventory, players can press C by default to open the Radial Menu. The Menu displays items that are already equipped, as well as items in the player's inventory that can be equipped, but currently aren't.

Left-clicking tabs with green text will equip the displayed item onto the player, while left-clicking tabs with red text will unequip the displayed item from the player and place it back into their inventory.

Equipped items do not take up a normal inventory slot, but note that only two rings or one pouch can be equipped at a time, while the number of Amulets varies depending on how many times an Amulet Slot has been used since the player's last death, from 1 by default, up to 3. While equipped, items will appear in a small space to the right of the hotbar.

When items are equipped in Creative Mode, the item does not disappear from the player's inventory, instead duplicating the item and equipping the new one.
