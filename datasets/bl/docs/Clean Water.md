# Clean Water

**Clean Water** is a liquid that can be acquired by filtering Swamp Water through a Water Filter. It can be collected from the Barrel it filters into with a Weedwood or Syrmorite Bucket, and used in a Steeping Pot for steeping Fish Oil, as well as cooking a variety of Drinkable Brews. Clean Water cannot be placed.
