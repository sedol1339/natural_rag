Collection
------------

Swamp Plants must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Leaf, which can then be ground into Ground Leaf.

Growing
---------

Swamp Plants will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Swamp Plants can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Swamp Plants have a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 4. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Swamp Plants will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.
