Description
-------------

Shallowbreaths are living, moving clouds of toxic gas. They come in different colors depending on their origin. When found in Marshes, they are a pale green color; but when spawned from an evaporated infusion, they take on infusion's colouration.

They are capable of passing through blocks and drift aimlessly near the ground if no players are nearby. If a player comes close, they will give chase slightly slower than sprinting speed. They try to stay on top of the player, dealing constant suffocation damage as well as inflicting Poison I () for 2 seconds. When damaged they take no knockback.

Strategy
----------

The sudden, constant speed of Shallowbreaths can make them dangerous, as they can be on top of an unaware player in seconds. The marsh's uneven terrain can make it hard to escape, although they can usually be spotted and avoided easily, and do not have too much health if one decides to fight. Shallowbreaths also can't go through liquids, which can help players to escape.

To avoid spawning them from an evaporated infusion, make sure to stir the Infuser constantly so that it does not evaporate.

Hitting them with either type of Dentrothyst Vial enough times will fill it with Shallowbreath fluid, which is used to power the Draeton.
