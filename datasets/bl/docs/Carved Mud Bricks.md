Carved Mud Bricks ingame

**Carved Mud Bricks** are craftable building blocks. They have a normal variant and an Edge variant, each of which has four increasingly Sludgy variants that use connected textures. In addition to being crafted, all variants can be found as part of the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, and Crypt of the Sludgeon, the level of "sludginess" increasing with deeper levels.
