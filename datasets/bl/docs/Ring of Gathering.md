The **Ring of Gathering** is a unique item that can summon and revive lost minions and pets. It can be obtained in the Barrishee lair room after defeating the Barrishee in the fourth layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults and rarely from Tar Pots of Chance in Tar Pool Dungeons.

How to Equip
--------------

The Ring of Gathering can be right-clicked to equip it onto the player in an invisible slot beside the hotbar. Note that only two rings can be equipped at a time.

The Ring of Gathering is equipped through the Radial Equipment Menu, which can be opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any ring equipped onto the player (in red tab) as well as rings in their inventory (in green tab). A ring can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management of ring equipping.

Effect
--------

Mobs tamed while wearing the ring are able to be summoned back to the player at the cost of experience by right-clicking the ring item while unequipped. Tamed mobs that die while the ring is equipped are able to be revived by animating the ring in an Animator. Note that tame mobs killed while wearing the ring will not drop their usual drops. In the case of Tarminions, right-clicking the ring while unequipped will give the Inanimate Tarminion back to the player, should they not pick it up when it dies.

An indication that the ring can be used is shown by the durability. A white color indicates a pet that can be revived or summoned, while a red or orange color indicates you have Tarminions that have died; their inanimate forms can be received by right-clicking.
