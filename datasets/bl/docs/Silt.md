Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Silt generates rimming the edges of large water bodies in Swamplands and Patchy Islands biomes, as part of Silt Beaches.

Properties
------------

### Movement
Silt slows down the movement of players and non-Betweenlands mobs by a moderate amount when walked over. This slowing can be negated by wearing Rubber Boots or Boots of the Marsh Runner.

Betweenlands mobs are not slowed by Silt.

### Spawning
Silt supports the spawning of Silt Crabs in Patchy Islands biomes, and Bubbler Crabs in Swamplands biomes.

### Events
Placed Silt will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.
