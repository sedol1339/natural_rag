Properties
------------

### Placement
Sulfur Torches can only be placed on the top and side of most blocks. Breaking the block a Sulfur Torch is sitting on or attached to will cause the torch to break as well. They cannot be placed underwater, and will break if water flows into them.

### Particles
Yellow sulfur particles will emanate from the tips of Sulfur Torches.

### Providing Light
Lit Sulfur Torches provide a light level of 14, the same as vanilla Torches. However, unlike them, they do not become Damp Torches when placed in The Betweenlands. Instead, they will eventually become Extinguished Sulfur Torches if they are exposed to rain from the Heavy Rain event, no longer providing light. Extinguished Sulfur Torches can be relit either by right-clicking them with an Octine Ingot or by smelting them.

Lanterns are an alternative light source that will not be extinguished by Heavy Rain.
