They can also drop from looting Greebling Corpses.

### Loot
Dragonfly Wings can be found as Loot from Pots of Chance in Underwater Ruins.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Dragonfly Wings have a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, they can be right-clicked on the juvenile to feed it.

### Taming
Dragonfly Wings can be right-clicked on a Harlequin Toad to feed it. Once the Harlequin Toad is fed anywhere between 8 and 30 wings, it will become tamed.
