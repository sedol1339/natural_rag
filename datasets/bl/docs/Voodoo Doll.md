Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Voodoo Doll** (28 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (12% charge) |  |

How to Use
------------

The Voodoo Doll can be used by right-clicking it when there are mobs nearby in a 5-block radius around the player. If there are, it will damage all of the mobs in that radius and consume one use, playing a special sound and causing white particles to emanate from affected mobs. If not, the doll will not consume any uses. It is important to note that any mobs killed with the Voodoo Doll are NOT counted as player kills, meaning they will not drop experience or any items that require the mob to be killed by the player to drop. The Voodoo Doll's effect will also not work on any players or boss mobs.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Voodoo Doll.
