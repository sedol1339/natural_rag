Obtaining
-----------

Infested Bushes can be obtained by right-clicking a Weedwood Bush with a Pheromone Thorax. The bush will then progress through the stages of infestation, from Moths, to Silk Grubs, to Silk Cocoons, to Decay, until only a Dead Weedwood Bush is left.

Grub Hubs filled with Pheromone Extract can be used to infuse adjacent Weedwood Bushes with pheromones.

Properties
------------

### Appearance
* Pheromone Infused Bushes emit smoke-like particles.
* Moth Infested Bushes emit particles resembling moths.
* Silk Grub Infested Bushes have visible animated Silk Grubs.
* Silk Cocooned Bushes have visible Silk Cocoons.
* Decay Infested Bushes are brown and emit green potion particles.

### Infestation
Standing inside an Infested Weedwood Bush infests the player with bugs, similar to the Infestation's effect.

At the final stage of infestation, an Infestation is spawned, leaving behind a Dead Weedwood Bush.

### Harvesting
When broken, Silk Grub Infested and Silk Cocooned Bushes will drop 1 Silk Grub or 1 Silk Cocoon, respectively. All other stages will drop nothing.

When right clicked with shears, the infested bush becomes a Weedwood Bush, dropping 2 of the respective item.

A Grub Hub will harvest adjacent Silk Grub Infested Bushes, gaining 1 Silk Grub and resetting the bush. If given Pheromone Extract, it will re-infuse the Weedwood Bush, repeating the process.
