Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Weeping Blue Petals drop from breaking Weeping Blues.

### Loot
Weeping Blue Petals can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underground Ruins, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues, Shrines, Cragrock Towers, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.
* Offering Tables that sometimes generate next to Simulacra throughout The Betweenlands.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Weeping Blue Petals restore 1 hunger and 1 saturation. They also grant the  Elixir of Ripening III effect for 30 seconds, which restores the player's decay bar over time. They can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is already full.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Weeping Blue Petals have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Weeping Blue Petals have a 25% chance to restore 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Censing
Weeping Blue Petals can be used as an effect source for the Censer. When fueled, this will slowly restore the decay bar of any player in a 65x65x19 area around the Censer, at a rate of 2 decay () restored every 5 seconds. The effect is indicated by a small blue puff. Each Weeping Blue Petal can restore decay up to 7 times for a total of 14 decay (), and will not be used up until this decay restoration is absorbed.
