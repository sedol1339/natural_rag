Properties
------------

### Igniting
An Octine Ingot can be used as a tool for creating fire. This can be done by holding right-click on either a placed or dropped block of Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, or Thorns (or the corresponding dropped Plant Item or Ground Item) with the Octine Ingot. The ingot will cause the plant to slowly build up flame until it turns into a fire block, without consuming the ingot in the process. This is one of the only ways to make fire in The Betweenlands, since Flint and Steel does not function in the dimension. If created on Peat, the fire can then be put out to create Smoldering Peat, which is necessary for the Smoking Rack and Infuser to function.

Note that fire cannot be used to create a Nether portal in The Betweenlands.

### Relighting
An Octine Ingot can be right-clicked on a placed Sulfur Torch that has been extinguished by rain from the Heavy Rain event to relight it. This process will also not consume the ingot.

Uses
------

### Healing
Octine Ingots can be right-clicked on a tamed Emberling to feed it, healing it back to full health.
