Equipment
-----------

Silt Crabs and Bubbler Crabs can be caught with a Crab Pot baited with Anadia Parts. They can then be used for Filtering.

Anadia are caught with a Weedwood Fishing Rod and Net placed in the offhand. They are more likely to bite when the rod is baited with a Tiny Sludge Worm.

### Fishing Mini-game
When an Anadia bites, a mini-game begins. The goal is to reel the Anadia all the way to the right by right-clicking, but keep in mind this action causes an amount of **hunger drain**. Various obstacles will pass across the screen, preventing the player from reeling it in. After a few seconds, a Silt Crab will appear; if the crab gets the Anadia, the game is lost and the rod will need new bait. Pressing right click while the Anadia is under an obstacle causes the crab to approach faster. To finally catch the fish you need to right click the fish at the end of the Fishing rod with the net in the offhand.

### Treasure Fish
When a Treasure Anadia bites, a chest icon will appear in the mini-game. The treasure can be unlocked by pressing right click over the chest. A Treasure Fish will yield treasure in the Fish Trimming Table. If the treasure is not unlocked in the mini-game, the Anadia can be released and fished again for another chance to unlock it.

Processing
------------

### Fish Trimming
Anadia can be trimmed in the Fish Trimming Table. The loot is affected by the Anadia's size and model type. Loot from fish trimming can be used for Filtering and Amphibious Armor.
