Collection
------------

Copper Irises must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop Copper Iris Petals, which can then be ground into Ground Copper Iris.

Growing
---------

Copper Irises will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Copper Irises can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Copper Irises have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
