| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purifier** | Weedwood Planks (5) + Octine Ingot (3) |  |

How to Use
------------

The purifying interface can be accessed by right-clicking the Purifier. Purifying requires the following items:

* Sulfur, which is placed in the lower left slot of the interface. Each purified item consumes 1 Sulfur.
* Swamp Water, which can be put inside the Purifier by right-clicking it with a Weedwood or Syrmorite Bucket of Swamp Water. The Purifier can also collect rainwater from the Betweenlands over time, as long as it is exposed to the sky during the Heavy Rain event. Up to four buckets (4000 mB or millibuckets) worth of Swamp Water can be inside the Purifier, and each purified item consumes a quarter of a bucket's worth of water (250 mB). The amount of Swamp Water in the Purifier can be viewed in the liquid meter of the interface.
* The item that is to be purified, which is placed in the upper left slot of the interface.

Once these requirements are met, the Purifier will begin the purification process. A sulfur flame icon will deplete based on how much time is left before the next Sulfur item will be consumed. Similarly, a progress arrow will fill based on how much time is left before the process is complete. Each item takes around 22.5 seconds to be purified.

While purifying, the Purifier will emit light as well as bubble and steam particles, and a bubbling sound will also play. Resulting items will render at the bottom of the Purifier.

Due to how Corrosion in the Betweenlands works, corrodable items that are inside any storage container, including a Purifier, will stop corroding, only resuming if they are taken out of the purifier.

Once the purifying process is complete, 1 Sulfur and 250 mB of Swamp Water will have been consumed, and the resulting item can be retrieved from the right slot of the interface.
