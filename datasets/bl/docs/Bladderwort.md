Obtaining
-----------

Bladderwort Flowers and Stalks must be harvested individually with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle instead, the Flower drops a Bladderwort Flower (item) and the Stalk drops a Bladderwort Stalk (item), both of which can then be ground into Ground Bladderwort Flower and Ground Bladderwort Stalk, respectively.

### Growing
Bladderwort Stalks will very slowly naturally grow upwards towards the surface, generating new Bladderwort Stalks. Once they reach the surface, they will blossom and generate a Bladderwort Flower one block above the water.

Potting
---------

Bladderwort Flowers can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again. Bladderwort Stalks cannot be placed inside of pots.

Compostability
----------------

Bladderwort Flowers and Stalks have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
