**Nesting Blocks** are bush-like blocks found exclusively in Chiromaw Matriarch Nests. They come in two variants, one embedded with Weedwood Sticks, and one embedded with Slimy Bones.

Description
-------------

Nesting Blocks appear as non-solid blocks that can be slowly walked through, similarly to Weedwood Bushes. Unlike them however, they will continuously deal half a heart of damage to the player as long as they are in contact with it. Naturally generated Nesting Blocks also have a chance to spawn with various loot items and Greebling Corpses stuck to them, along with Chiromaw Hatchlings when part of an active nest.

Nesting Blocks in-game.

Collection
------------

Nesting Blocks are unobtainable until the nest is claimed and the destruction ward dissipates. Once obtainable, both the regular and slimy bone variants can be broken by hand to yield either one Weedwood Stick or one Slimy Bone respectively. Any loot caught within the Nesting Blocks will also drop. The blocks themselves can be harvested with Syrmorite Shears.

Growing
---------

Both variants of Nesting Blocks will grow to adjacent blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.
