Explanation of Loot Tables
----------------------------

There are several key terms used to determine items within a loot table.

* "**Rolls**" refers to the number of times an item type (usually from a selection of items) is called per inventory using the loot table.
* "**Quantity**" refers to the amount of the called item that can be found per roll, including minimum/maximum.
* "**Weight**" refers to how likely the item is to be called per roll when compared to the total weight of items in the selection (in general, the smaller the weight number, the rarer the item is).

### Shared Loot
Some loot pools also use a custom *Shared Loot* system that can determine guaranteed or minimum/maximum loot for an entire location.

* "**Shared Pools**" are where the items that can be shared per location are designated and pulled from. Rolls in Shared Pools apply to the collective inventories for an entire location that are using the same loot table, not for each individual inventory.
* From here, the shared items are called from somewhere else in the loot table. The rolls and weights listed in these selections are applied per inventory using the loot table, as with unshared items, but will consume a roll from the Shared Pool when the item is called. This means that while each inventory has its own chance to contain the item, there can only be as many appearances of the item per location as is designated by the Shared Pool.
  + Additionally, items can have a "**Guaranteed After**" condition, which means that if the item has not yet appeared in any other inventory upon checking a certain amount of inventories within each location (either a specific number or a percentage, inclusive), the current inventory will always contain the item (and pull a roll from the Shared Pool). This allows an entire location to be guaranteed to contain a specific item within one of its loot inventories.

See shared\_loot\_pool\_test for an example of a loot table with shared loot, or this GitHub issue for more detailed information regarding shared loot.
