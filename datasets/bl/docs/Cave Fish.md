Spawning
----------

Cave Fish spawn in the water in the Lake Cavern layer.

Behavior
----------

Cave Fish will usually ignore the player, but if they are in the water, they will flee instead, but are generally considered "Passive."

Cave Fish will swarm around a Leader, usually being the larger of the school (or a group of fish). If a school of Cave Fish has no leader, one Cave Fish will become the leader, but if two Cave Fish Leaders meet, they will fight. Following this, if one Leader survives, then the rest of the school will begin following the new leader.

### Catching
Cave Fish can be caught with a Net.
