Black Ice ingame

**Black Ice** is a block that is created when Swamp Water freezes over from land edges without enough light during the Winter seasonal event.

Movement
----------

Like vanilla Ice, Black Ice is slippery, causing players, mobs and items to slide across it.

Melting
---------

When a light source is placed near it, Black Ice will eventually melt back into Swamp Water. It will also eventually melt once the Winter event is no longer active.

Collection
------------

Black Ice will drop nothing, but leaves behind Swamp Water when broken. It must be harvested with a Silk Touch tool to be collected, but it will not leave behind Swamp Water if broken this way.

History
---------

* Alpha 3.1.0: Introduced.
