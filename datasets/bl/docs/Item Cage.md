The Puzzle
------------

The Armory of the Wight Fortress is a special puzzle room, featuring Spike Traps on the floor as well as four Item Cages directing energy beams towards the center orb of the room. The Item Cages as well as the center orb emit blue shader light, and each of the cages contains a piece of the Shockwave Sword. You are supposed to break all four Item Cages, but ONLY while standing directly underneath them (indicated by the Glowing Betweenstone Tiles in the room) while maneuvering around the Spike Traps. The cages can be mined by hand but are most efficiently broken with an axe. Once the cages are broken, the released pieces will float towards the center orb and, once all four are united, the orb will disappear and leave behind the Shockwave Sword.

Collection
------------

Item Cages release the item inside of them when harvested, but otherwise drop nothing. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in any way.
