**Gallery Frames** are decorative items, placeable as entities, that depict fan-made artwork for the Betweenlands mod. In a sense, they are the Betweenlands equivalent of vanilla Paintings.

There are three size variants of Gallery Frame: **Small** (1x1 block), **Large** (2x2 blocks), and **Very Large** (4x4 blocks).

Properties

### Placement
Like vanilla Paintings, Gallery Frames can be placed on the sides of most blocks if space is available, and will break if their supporting blocks are covered or removed.

### Displaying Artwork
The Gallery Manager tool in use

Unlike vanilla Paintings, Gallery Frames are initially blank when placed. Right-clicking on them opens an interface where the player can select the artwork they want to display, either by scrolling through the available selections, choosing a random selection, or searching for the artwork's title, artist, or description with a search bar. If available, the interface will also display the current artwork's title, author, brief description, and a link to the full sized image. Lengthy descriptions may be cut off by the edge of the screen. All three sizes of Gallery Frame can each display the same selection of artwork, just in different sizes.

Artwork can come in a wide range of aspect ratios and resolutions, up to 512x512. Images with an aspect ratio other than 1:1 display the empty spaces as transparent. The Gallery Manager tool can be used to view gallery submissions and edit them locally, although it does not allow changes to be loaded into the game.

On the technical side, new artwork entries are committed to a separate GitHub branch, and can be added to the mod without having to install an updated version.

A Gallery Frame can be broken and collected back by punching it.

#### Artwork Submission
More info from the Discord server on how to submit your own artwork to the gallery:

> "Ever wanted to make your mark on The Betweenlands? Well now you can, kind of! With all the fantastic fanart that we receive, we have decided to create a new decorative painting block that acts like an in-game fanart gallery, and now we need your submissions to fill it up. So here's how its gonna work:
>
> *- You must submit a piece of Betweenlands related fanart either by posting it in the **#showcase** channel or by Tweeting it to us at @BetweenlandsDev on Twitter.*
>
> *- You must use the hashtag **#BetweenlandsGallery** when submitting so that we can find your submission easily.*
>
> *- Please also give it a name or title to be shown ingame, otherwise we have to make one up ;). You can also optionally give it a description to be shown ingame.*
>
> *- The maximum size of the picture in the ingame gallery frame is 512x512. You can submit larger pieces (as the ingame gallery frame will link to the source, if available, e.g. on Twitter), but we'll have to scale for the ingame gallery frame. Width and height can be different, they're scaled to fit the ingame gallery frame (while keeping aspect ratio the same of course).*
>
> **Important:** by submitting your fanart to this competition using the hashtag #BetweenlandsGallery you are consenting to your work being used in the mod and hosted on our GitHub repository and for your username to be credited. If you wish you can also give us a source URL/link to be added to the ingame gallery! There is no final deadline to this competition, rather we will continually add to the gallery whenever we see a piece of artwork that we like. So good luck! We look forward to seeing what you guys create The submissions are also posted in the new #the-gallery channel."

The sky had a long tear across it, shining brightly in the darkest of hours, intriguing. Something was oddly familiar about this too but I just couldn't quite put my finger on it. It was almost like it was a rift in the night sky. How peculiar... |
| **Moonless Night** |  | Støne | A traveller once came to me and told tales of his land, one that intrigued me greatly was of a large spherical object hovering in the sky. 'The Moon!' he said, 'It feels weird not having one here. Those orbs are pretty though!', we didn't speak of it much more, something found us... |
| **Effortless Resistance** |  | Støne | An old acquaintance of mine from long ago had an interesting quirk, he used to consume the sap from the trees that grew nearby. He said to me 'The taste isn't that bad, it renews me in some way, like I still feel like myself'. I always laughed it off and took it as a weird preference of his, or some silly superstition. I didn't laugh anymore when I was reading through his old studies on that unfortunate night. I haven't laughed much since... |

| **Some Old Breadknife** |  | STARRYSOCK | An old scroll dredged up from the muck of a swamp. Is that some kind of sword, or just a mud stain that won't rub off? |
| **At the Bottom of the World, I'll be Waiting** |  | STARRYSOCK | N/A |
| **Gazing up at a Distant, Uncaring Sky** |  | STARRYSOCK | Just what are those pale, green, glittering stars? Maybe they're holes, pinpricks of light from a world above. Maybe they're ancient wisps, swaddled in the aurora's embrace. Maybe they're both. Or maybe they're something even greater... |
