Crafting Recipe

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Repeller** | Green Dentrothyst Vial + Weedwood Stick (2) + Cragrock |  |

How to Use
------------

The Repeller requires a Shimmerstone to function, which can be deposited with right-click, emitting a shine effect, and taken out by shift-right-clicking with an empty hand. The Repeller must also be fueled with Byariis Aspect by right-clicking their Aspect Vial onto it, which can also be taken out with an empty Dentrothyst Vial. Once fueled, it will create a wavy blue/green shield around itself.

Most hostile and neutral mobs inside or attempting to enter the shield will be pushed away, while players, Wights, and boss mobs are unaffected. Additionally, the shield will also push out and reflect most projectiles such as Arrows, Betweenstone Pebbles, and Pyrad Flames, even if shot by the player. Hostile mobs can still spawn inside the repeller's radius, but will be pushed outside as soon as they do so.

The size of the shield can be changed by right-clicking the Repeller with an empty hand. The default radius is about 4 blocks, but can expand to ~8, ~13, and ~17.5. Shields from multiple Repellers can also overlap.

The Repeller can be filled with a maximum of 10.0 Byariis Aspect as fuel, which will deplete very slowly over time. The depletion rate increases with larger shield sizes, as well as with more mobs attempting to breach the shield. The amount of fuel in the Repeller can be viewed visually in its vial. Should the Repeller run out of fuel, the shield will deactivate.

Fuel
------

The Repeller can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per Repeller.
