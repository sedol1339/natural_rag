Digging

Right-clicking on Purified Swamp Dirt with a Betweenlands shovel will turn it into Dug Purified Swamp Dirt. This block is particularly useful in Farming due to its ability to grow crops while being immune to the effects of decay. Note that the block will revert back to regular Purified Swamp Dirt if it is left unfilled.
