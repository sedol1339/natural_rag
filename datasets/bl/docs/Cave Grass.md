Placement
-----------

Unlike other plants, Cave Grass can be placed on top of Pitstone and Betweenstone, in addition to any normal plant-supporting block.

Collection
------------

Cave Grass must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Cave Grass Blades, which can then be ground into Ground Cave Grass.

Growing
---------

Cave Grass will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Cave Grass can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. It can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Cave Grass has a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
