Placement
-----------

String Roots can only be placed on the underside of blocks, as well as directly below themselves. Breaking a higher part of a String Roots growth will break all parts below it as well.

Particles
-----------

String Roots will occasionally drip water particles.

Collection
------------

String Roots must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop String Root Fibers, which can then be ground into Ground String Roots.

Growth
--------

String Roots that have been placed directly by the player grow down from blocks like Vines. Like other Sludgeon plants, they must also be placed in the range of an active Censer that is being sourced with Bottled Fog in order to grow. Instead of being placed directly in the fog, the top part of the growth must be placed between one and four blocks above the fog.

Compostability
----------------

String Roots have a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 8. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
