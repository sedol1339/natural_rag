Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Smoldering Peat occasionally generates within patches of Peat found in Marshes.

### Creating
Smoldering Peat can be made by lighting Peat on fire and extinguishing it.

Usage
-------

Smoldering Peat can act as a heat source for the Infuser, and is also necessary for operating a Smoking Rack. Smoldering Peat can be put out by left clicking it, which reverts it to normal Peat.

Decoration
------------

Placing a Weedwood Chip Path on top of Smoldering Peat will cause it to emit black smoke instead of its usual steam particles.

Updrafts
----------

If a player using a Volarkite glides closely above Smoldering Peat, the heat will create an updraft that pushes them upwards, giving them a constant vertical boost for about a second.
