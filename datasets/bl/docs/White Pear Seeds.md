Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
White Pear Seeds drop from breaking Seeded Hangers.

They can also drop rarely from Root Sprites upon death.

Properties
------------

### Farming
White Pear Seeds can be planted in Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass that has been fertilized with Compost. The seeds grow into a White Pear Plant crop that will produce edible White Pears.

A White Pear Plant will grow over time until ready to be harvested. Its growth can be augmented with Ground Dried Swamp Reed. When harvested at full maturity, the bush will drop White Pears and more seeds.

However, a White Pear Plant's growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed. If the plant is mature when this happens, it will decay as well, dropping nothing but seeds.

Uses
------

### Compostability
White Pear Seeds can be composted in a Compost Bin. They have a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 10. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
