Description
-------------

### Appearance
Lampreys, much like their real life inspiration, are eel-like creatures with large, circular mouths filled with several rings of teeth. Unlike real lampreys, however, they do not live in an aquatic environment, and instead reside in holes in the walls, floors, and ceilings of the Labyrinthine Vaults. Only their heads are visible when they emerge from their burrows.

### Behavior
In the absence of a nearby player, Lampreys will appear simply as a dark hole in a block, identical to a Worm Hole. When approached by a player, Lampreys will come out of their burrows and attempt to pull the player towards them by inhaling. This pull becomes stronger the closer an entity is to the Lamprey. In addition to dealing damage, their melee attack will sap the player's Decay. When burrowed into the ceiling, a Lamprey will attack its target using a ranged spit attack, which does not drain Decay.

Like Worm Holes and Living Roots, if their target moves out of their line of sight Lampreys will relocate themselves, disappearing into their burrows and sealing them off, then opening a new hole closer to their target's location. Also like these two mobs, the amount of health a Lamprey has is indicated by how damaged its hole appears - the more cracked it appears, the less health the mob has.

Strategy
----------

Lampreys are not usually a huge problem, however, it is a horrible idea to ignore them. if you do this, you will discover that their decaying bites build up fast and with only 3 bites you'll find out that they ate your entire decay bar. To counter this, it's best to eat Weeping Blue Petals first and back away whenever they suck in.

Drops
-------

The drops from Lampreys are derived from the wall\_lamprey loot table. However, this contains no content by default.
