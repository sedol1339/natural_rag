Collecting Loot
-----------------

Each Urn of Chance will drop one or more items from a location-based loot table when broken. Be careful, as there is a chance that an urn will also spawn a small Termite when broken by the player. If an urn is broken by a screaming Barrishee, it will instead always spawn an Ash Sprite. Like with Pots of Chance, items can be extracted one by one with shift right click as well as stored with right click. 3 stacks of items can be stored.

Urns of Chance can be broken by hand but are most effectively broken with a pickaxe.

Loot
------

The loot in Urns of Chance is derived from three loot tables:

* sludge\_plains\_ruins\_urn is used by urns in Sludge Plains Ruins.
* sludge\_worm\_dungeon\_urn is used by urns in the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.
* sludge\_worm\_dungeon\_crypt\_urn is used by urns in the Crypt of the Sludgeon.

Visit the Loot Tables page for the contents of these loot tables.

The Urns of Chance themselves cannot be collected in any way.
