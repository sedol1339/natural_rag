Spawning
----------

Untamed Chiromaws spawn in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers. They can also spawn occasionally in any biome on the surface of The Betweenlands, *except* for Deep Waters and Swamplands Clearing biomes.

### Spawners
Untamed Chiromaws spawn from some Monster Spawners in Cragrock Towers and the Wight Fortress.

### Hatchlings
Untamed Chiromaws can be hatched from wild Chiromaw Hatchlings. Tamed Chiromaws can be raised from non-wild hatchlings, including as a regular variant or as a Tamed Lightning Chiromaw if raised from a Lightning Chiromaw Hatchling.

Behavior
----------

Chiromaws will often hang upside down from the ceilings of caves or structures before targeting the player. They extend their wings and fly around with great weight, flapping towards the player and dealing basic melee damage. They strike quickly and are most effective in a swarm.

Chiromaws can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

### Taming
A Tamed Chiromaw can be raised by properly hatching and feeding a non-wild Chiromaw Hatchling. Tamed Chiromaws will follow and teleport to the player, attacking any hostile mobs nearby by shooting barbs at them. When a Tamed Lightning Chiromaw's barbs hit an enemy, they will shock other nearby entities. When right clicked, they will sit on the player's head, giving them a double jump. They will still attack hostile mobs in this state. Right clicking on a ceiling will remove the Tamed Chiromaw from your head and place it hanging from the block. They can be healed with Raw Snail Flesh.

### Catching
Tamed Chiromaws, including Tamed Lightning Chiromaws, can be right-clicked with a Net to capture them as an inventory item. This item can then be right-clicked on the ground to release the Tamed Chiromaw or Tamed Lightning Chiromaw as an entity there.
