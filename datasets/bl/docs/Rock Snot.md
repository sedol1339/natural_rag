Behavior
----------

While underwater, Rock Snots will attack *almost* any entity, grasping them with long, toothy tendrils before drawing them in and slowly killing them. The player can sneak to get out of their grip, though the tendrils themselves, like the Shambler's tongue attack, will never hurt the victim - only contact with the Rock Snot.

Rock Snots will only target one entity at a time, even if that entity is outside of their reach. Lurkers are excluded from their diet, however Wights, despite being roughly the same size, will be attacked.

### Taming
Animating a Snot item will result in a **Rocksnot Pod**, which can be placed as a tamed Rock Snot. Tamed Rock Snots will attack almost everything, except the player or bosses. Unlike with an untamed Rock Snot, entities will appear to descend as the tamed Rock Snot eats them, disappearing after a short time. This can be useful for more stronger entities or typical nuisances, such as the Infestation (of which get eaten in their entirety, rather than break apart, due to the methods of Tamed Rock Snots) - if they manage to get into water.

The tamed Rock Snot will spit out a Rocksnot Pearl for every 20 experience collected. Keep in mind that a Rocksnot Pearl only gives 10 experience.

Untamed Rock Snots do not produce pearls when eating.
