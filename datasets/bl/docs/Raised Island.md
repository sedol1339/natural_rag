Raised Isles

**Raised Islands** are mounds of land atop Giant Roots that generate in Raised Isles biomes, a variant of Coarse Islands biomes. They contain many of the same features as the land below them, including the same plants, trees, and mobs. They can also occasionally feature small lakes, and uncommonly Chiromaw Matriarch Nests inhabited by Chiromaw Matriarchs. An alternative ambient track plays in the area around each island.
