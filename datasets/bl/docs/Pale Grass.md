Collection
------------

Pale Grass must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Pale Grass Blades, which can then be ground into Ground Pale Grass.

Growing
---------

Pale Grass will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. Like other Sludgeon plants, it must also be placed in the range of an active Censer that is being sourced with Bottled Fog in order to grow. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Pale Grass can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. It can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Pale Grass has a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 8. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
