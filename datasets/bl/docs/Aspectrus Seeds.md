Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Aspectrus Seeds drop rarely from Root Sprites.

### Loot
Aspectrus Seeds can be found as Loot from pots in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underground Ruins, and Tar Pool Dungeons; from urns in Sludge Plains Ruins; and from chests in Cragrock Towers, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Farming
Aspectrus Seeds can be planted in Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass that has been fertilized with Compost and is directly below a Rubber Tree Plank Fence (up to 3 fences high). The seeds grow into an Aspectrus Plant crop that will produce Aspectrus Fruit harnessing an Aspect of the player's choice.

An Aspectrus Plant will not grow until it has been imbued with an aspect to take on. This can be done by sourcing an active Censer within range of the plant with an Aspect Vial that has the aspect you wish to farm. As long as the Censer is outputting the corresponding Aspect, the plant will grow over time up the fence until ready to be harvested. Unlike other crops, its growth *cannot* be augmented with Ground Dried Swamp Reed. The bulb of the plant will eventually take on a color and glow correlating to its applied aspect. If the plant is fully grown, it can then extend to any fence that is above the first fence block; it can grow up to three blocks on this fence pole.

When harvested at full maturity, the plant will drop Aspectrus Fruit and more seeds. The fruit will be imbued with the aspect that the plant was grown in. The amount of aspect in each harvested fruit is always 0.25, regardless of the value of the Aspect Vial used in the Censer to grow the Aspectrus Plant it was harvested from.

However, an Aspectrus Plant's growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed. If the plant is mature when this happens, it will decay as well, dropping nothing but seeds.

Uses
------
