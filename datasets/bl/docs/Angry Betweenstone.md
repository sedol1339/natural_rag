Angry Betweenstone in a rare Marsh Ruin

**Angry Betweenstone** is a building block that can be found as part of a rare Marsh Ruins variant (towards the inner corner, though it may be obscured by other blocks). It appears similar to Betweenstone Tiles, but with a large, glowing red, upside-down "A" in its center.
