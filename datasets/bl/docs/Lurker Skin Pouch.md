How to Use
------------

The Lurker Skin Pouch can be opened by right-clicking on the item or with a hotkey (G by default, prioritizes any equipped pouch first). It provides additional inventory slots with which one can store items inside like a chest and open again when needed; only, it is stored in an item you can carry around. For convenience, shift right-clicking the pouch on an inventory storage block, such as a chest, will deposit as many items as possible from the pouch into the block.

When first crafted, Lurker Skin Pouches have only 9 item slots. However, they can be upgraded up to three times, each time adding an additional 9 slots to the pouch's storage, up to a maximum possible 36 item slots. This can be done by surrounding the Lurker Skin Pouch with more Lurker Skin through crafting. Note that "nested storage" is not possible; that is, you cannot put one pouch inside another to exploit infinite storage.

When shift-right clicked, the pouch will open an interface where a custom name for the pouch can be input and saved. This makes it easy for one to organize their pouches based on what items they mean to put inside.

The Lurker Skin Pouch can optionally be equipped using the Radial Equipment Menu, which is opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any pouch equipped onto the player (in red tab) as well as pouches in their inventory (in green tab). A pouch can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management of pouch equipping. Equipped pouches appear in an invisible slot beside the hotbar and render on the side of the player, and can still be directly accessed with the G hotkey. However, note that only one pouch can be equipped at a time.
