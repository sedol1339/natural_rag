How to Equip
--------------

The Ring of Recruitment can be right-clicked to equip it onto the player in an invisible slot beside the hotbar. Note that only two rings can be equipped at a time.

The Ring of Recruitment is equipped through the Radial Equipment Menu, which is opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any ring equipped onto the player (in red tab) as well as rings in their inventory (in green tab). A ring can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management of ring equipping.

Effect
--------

When equipped, the Ring of Recruitment will provide the player with the ability to recruit most mobs they come across, including passive mobs. This can be done by holding right-click on the mob with an empty hand for a certain amount of seconds (depending on the mob's danger level), using special particles that transfer to the mob. While recruiting, the player's movement speed is significantly reduced, and they will be unable to defend themselves. When recruited, the mob will be bathed in a teal color and be linked to the player by an energy tether. Multiple mobs may be recruited at once, but the number of mobs is limited based on the health and attack damage of each mob. The amount of recruiting "power" left in the ring is indicated by the durability left when in the invisible slot next to the hotbar. If there is not enough power left in the ring, a message will appear above the hotbar saying that the ring doesn't have enough power to recruit the entity.

Mobs recruited by the ring cannot be hurt by the player. By default, recruited mobs will be in the "stay" mode. Right-clicking them with an empty hand will put them in the "follow" mode. While in the "follow" mode, recruited mobs will follow the player, teleporting to them if they are too far away, and can be ordered to move to a specific location by right-clicking that location with an empty hand, producing a particle effect when the location is successfully chosen. They will also fight by the player's side if they have any attack capability, using their own attacks against non-recruited enemies that are attacked by the player. They can be unrecruited by shift right-clicking them with an empty hand.

When recruited mobs attack or take damage and get healed by the ring, experience is drained from the player. Should experience be fully depleted, any recruited mobs will no longer be recruited and originally hostile mobs will proceed to attack the player again.

Recruited mobs can be applied with Amulets, giving them a Middle Gem Circle modifier that directly affects the mob's own attacks and the player they are assigned to while they are alive. The number of amulets that they can equip at once can be extended with an Amulet Slot, and amulets can be taken off of them by shift right-clicking them.

The Ring of Recruitment can also be used to generate a shield, similar to that of the Primordial Malevolence. While wearing the ring, players can use their primary or secondary ring keybind on any recruited hostile mob to generate a shield. Recruited mobs take damage when shields are generated. Players can have up to 20 shields. Shields block any incoming attack that hits them, but will disappear after being hit. If a player's experience drops too low, their shields will disappear.
