Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Volarkite** | Volarpad or Volarpad Leaf (3) + Reed Rope (2) + Weedwood Stick (2) |  |

How to Use
------------

The player can right-click with the Volarkite to begin holding it, and if they are in the air at that time they will begin to glide in the direction they are facing. The player can still walk around while holding the kite as they normally would, as long as their feet are on solid ground.

While gliding, the player's falling speed is reduced and fall damage will be negated, which is useful for descending from large trees or into gaping caves. The velocity at which they are moving when they first start using the Volarkite affects the velocity that they start gliding at horizontally, but holding down forward will accelerate their speed and holding backward will decelerate it. Turning after activating the kite is possible but difficult, as it swings in a wider than usual arc.

If a player using a Volarkite glides closely above a heat source, such as fire, Lava, a Block of Octine, or Smoldering Peat, the heat will create an updraft that pushes them upwards, giving them a constant vertical boost for about a second.

The Volarkite's durability will drain over time as it is being used, and it will run out after about five minutes of being active. Pressing shift or selecting something else in the hotbar will cause the player to stop using the Volarkite, and it has a one-second cooldown before it can be used again.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Volarkite.
