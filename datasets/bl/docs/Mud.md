Obtaining
-----------

### Filtering Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mud** | Using Silt Crab: Swamp Dirt + Anadia Remains |  |

### Generation
Mud generates at the bottom of any water body in The Betweenlands. It also generates in large quantities on the surface of Marsh and Sludge Plains biomes, and in smaller patches on the surface of Swamplands biomes and the Sludge Plains Clearing sub-biome.

Properties
------------

### Particles
Small mud droplet particles will occasionally drip down from Mud when there is no block directly below it.

### Plant Support
Mud supports the placement and growth of basic plants.

### Movement
Mud will cause players and non-Betweenlands mobs to sink slightly when walked over, slowing down their movement greatly and preventing them from jumping. This sinking effect can be temporarily negated by drinking Shell Stock, or entirely negated by wearing Rubber Boots or Boots of the Marsh Runner, or by wearing at least one piece of Amphibious Armor and having at least 4 Anadia Fins upgrades equipped onto their total pieces. However, note that if the player or mob is under the effects of a Heavyweight Draught, they will still sink into Mud regardless of any negating effects.

Betweenlands mobs do not sink in Mud.

### Events
Placed Mud will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.
