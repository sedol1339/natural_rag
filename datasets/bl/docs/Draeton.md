The **Draeton** is a craftable airship fueled with Bottled Shallowbreath, and pulled by various flying Betweenlands creatures. It allows for rapid, easy travel across The Betweenlands.

The Draeton requires two additional item components, the **Draeton Balloon** and the **Draeton Burner**, to be crafted. It can also be outfitted with multiple upgrades, the main ones being the **Draeton Anchor Upgrade**, **Draeton Crafting Upgrade**, and **Draeton Furnace Upgrade**.

Inventory
-----------

The Draeton's GUI.

Right clicking the Burner under the Draeton's balloon opens an interface showing fuel levels, along with the option to purge it all from the inventory. It can hold up to 4 Bottled Shallowbreaths. Bottles can be right-clicked onto the Burner directly to refuel it.

Right clicking the center of the bottom of the boat allows players to access the Draeton's interface. The top slots can be filled with flying Betweenlands creatures caught with a net (Fireflies, Dragonflies, Tamed Chiromaws, and Tamed Lightning Chiromaws) to pull the Draeton. The front-middle slot serves as an item frame, primarily intended for displaying Amate Maps. The center-middle slot is for the Draeton Anchor, and the 4 surrounding it are for general Draeton Upgrades.

Lurker Skin Pouches can also be placed in upgrade slots for storage. To access them, simply right click their models on the sides of the ship.

Usage
-------

Like a boat, the Draeton can be entered with right-click, and will hold up to two players at once. Players can sneak for 3 seconds to exit the Draeton. Exiting the **Draeton** in midair causes it to plummet.

### Movement
While moving in any direction, pressing jump makes the Draeton go up and pressing the sprint key instead makes it go down.

### Combat
Chiromaws pulling the Draeton will attack mobs for the player as they would normally, however this means that they could hit each other with their barbs and fighting will ensue. To avoid this, avoid mobs the Chiromaws will attack or have the array face the attackers so the Chiromaws take incoming hits and won't hit each other.

Getting hit by projectiles or ramming the Draeton into something causes it to spring leaks, making it lose fuel faster and get pushed around by the force of the leak. These can be fixed by right clicking on the hole with Lurker Skin Patches. Leaks on the underside of the balloon can be fixed while riding the Draeton, but ones on top cannot be reached without exiting the Draeton.

### Upgrades
Once Draeton Upgrades are applied via the inventory, they can be used by interacting with their models on the Draeton. With the upgrades, a crafting table, furnace, or anchor can be applied. Lurker Skin Pouches can also be added for storage.

With the anchor upgrade, the player can choose to lower an anchor from the front-center of the boat. While it only lowers about 5 blocks, it is useful for stopping and landing more easily.
