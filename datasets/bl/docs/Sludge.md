**Sludges** are slime-like creatures that lurk in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes, as well as in Swamplands Clearing sub-biomes after the Spirit Tree in their center has been defeated.

Description
-------------

Sludges are larger variations of Smol Sludges. They appear as relatively cubic blobs of murky brown sludge with an animated skull in their center. They are all the same size.

When first spawned, they may or may not be visible and if not will be submerged within a dirt-type block, such as Swamp Dirt, Mud, or Sludgy Dirt. If a player comes close enough, they will leap out of the mud to attack. Like slimes, they move by hopping about. They leave a trail of Sludge wherever they go, which can hinder the player's movement severely. They attack with melee and, unlike Slimes, do not split when killed.

Sludges can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Sludge Slicer.

Strategy
----------

While they may not look too powerful, Sludges are rather deceptive. They move quicker than you would expect a slime-type creature to, and they hide in blocks only leaping out when you least expect it. Their attacks are also very rapid. The best way to deal with them is just to kill them as soon as possible to minimize the damage they will inflict on you. Also, break or avoid the sludge trails they leave behind, for they can make getting away much more difficult. Another good strategy is to lure one into water, which can turn whole hoards of sludges into cakewalks.

Drops
-------

The drops from Sludges are derived from the sludge loot table.
