Obtaining
-----------

### Trimming
Crab Claws are obtained from trimming a Silt Crab item or Bubbler Crab item in the Trimming Table.

### Drops
Crab Claws drop from Silt Crabs and Bubbler Crabs upon death.

They can also drop from looting Greebling Corpses.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Crab Claws restore 2 hunger and 1.2 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Crab Claws have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Crab Claws have a 25% chance to restore only 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

### Shearing
Using Crab Claws to break blocks will consume 1 claw from the stack and drop the block as if it was broken with Shears, allowing certain plant-based blocks to be collected and placed again. This functions on the same blocks that it does with vanilla Shears, as well as the following blocks:

* Algae, Arrow Arum
* Bladderwort (flower and stalk separately), Blue Eyed Grass, Blue Iris, Bog Bean (from flower or stalk), Boneset, Bottlebrush Grass, Broomsedge, Button Bush
* Cardinal Flower, Cattail, Cave Grass, Cave Moss, Copper Iris, Cryptweed
* Dead Weedwood Bush, Deep Water Coral, Double Swamp Tallgrass
* Edge Leaf, Edge Moss, Edge Shrooms
* Fallen Leaves
* Golden Club (from flower or stalk)
* Hanger (from normal or seeded), Hearthgrove Leaves
* Lichen (normal and dead separately)
* Marsh Hibiscus, Marsh Mallow, Marsh Marigold (from flower or stalk), Milkweed, Mire Coral, Moss (normal and dead separately)
* Nesting Block (both variants separately), Nettle (normal and flowered separately), Nibbletwig Leaves
* Pale Grass, Phragmites, Pickerel Weed, Pitcher Plant, Poison Ivy
* Rotbulb, Rubber Tree Leaves
* Sap Tree Leaves, Shoots, Sludgecreep, Soft Rush, Spirit Tree Leaves (upper, middle, and lower separately), String Roots, Sundew, Swamp Plant, Swamp Tallgrass
* Tall Cattail, Tall Sludgecreep, Thorns
* Venus Fly Trap, Volarpad
* Water Weeds, Weedwood Bush, Weedwood Leaves, Weeping Blue

Crab Claws can also be right-clicked on shearable vanilla mobs, performing the same function as vanilla Shears would. This will also consume 1 claw from the stack.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Crab Claws have a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, they can be right-clicked on the juvenile to feed it.
