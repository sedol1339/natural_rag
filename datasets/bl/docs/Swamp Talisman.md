There are six variants - the four **Swamp Talisman Pieces**, the talisman itself, and a special **Linked** version.

Obtaining
-----------

The Dark Druid Altar.

Swamp Talisman Pieces can be obtained by killing Dark Druids, which spawn at a Druid Circle. Each of the 4 unique piece types must then be assembled in the Dark Druid Altar to create the finished Swamp Talisman.

The Talisman can also be crafted using materials from the Betweenlands, in case it is lost later on:

| **Swamp Talisman** | Moss or Moss (item) or Cave Moss or Cave Moss (item) + Slimy Bone + Life Crystal |  |

How to Use
------------

A Portal Tree in The Overworld.

Right-clicking any Sapling with the Swamp Talisman will create a Portal Tree, containing four portals to The Betweenlands, provided there is enough space.

### Portal Linking
The Swamp Talisman can be used to link together two Tree Portals between any other dimension and The Betweenlands, as long as they are within 1500 blocks relative of each other in terms of the coordinates in both dimensions. Two linked Tree Portals will always transport players and other entities to each other, regardless of what portal they originally transported to.

To link a portal, first right-click the initial Tree Portal with the Swamp Talisman to turn it into a Linked Swamp Talisman containing the portal's coordinates (visible as part of its tooltip). Then, right-click the second Tree Portal with the Linked Talisman to link them.

The Swamp Talisman cannot be linked to the same Tree Portal, nor to two portals in the same dimension. One of the portals must also be in The Betweenlands. Additionally, right-clicking with a linked talisman anywhere, whether it successfully links the portals or not, will cause it to become unlinked again.

The maximum portal linking distance can be adjusted in the config.

### Portal Repairing
A reignited Portal.

The Swamp Talisman can be used to reignite a vertical 3x4 frame of Portal Frame blocks by right-clicking it on the base of the frame's center. The center will fill with a Tree Portal, and any Portal Frame blocks surrounding it will be rearranged into the usual pattern surrounding each portal.
