Obtaining

### Collection
Any **Dye Fluids** can be collected by right-clicking a Steeping Pot containing the corresponding **Dye fluid** with a bucket. Each bucket collects 1000 mB worth of fluid, meaning that every steeping process yields up to 4 Dye items.

Storing
---------

**Dye Fluids** can be stored in Barrels, Filtered Silt Glass Jars, and Steeping Pots. They store 8, 4, and 1 bucket of fluid respectively. They can be extracted back into empty buckets, or turned into usable Dyes by shift-right clicking with a Weedwood Bowl.
