Obtaining
-----------

### Trimming
Raw Anadia Meat is obtained from trimming any Anadia item (that is *not* smoked, rotten, or a treasure Anadia) in the Trimming Table. The amount obtained per item depends on the Anadia's Size attribute, with larger sizes yielding more meat.

### Drops
Raw Anadia Meat drops directly from Anadia upon death if killed by a player (as long as they are not on fire).

It can also drop from looting Greebling Coracles.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Raw Anadia Meat restores 2 hunger and 0.4 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Raw Anadia Meat has a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time it is eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Raw Anadia Meat has a 25% chance to restore only 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Raw Anadia Meat has a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, it can be right-clicked onto the juvenile to feed it.
