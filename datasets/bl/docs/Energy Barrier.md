Energy Barriers ingame

**Energy Barriers** are protective blocks that can be found as part of the Wight Fortress, shielding the player from fighting the Primordial Malevolence until they obtain the Shockwave Sword. They can also be found in the Sludgeon's main tower, stopping players from accessing certain parts of the puzzle from one side.

Particles
-----------

Green portal particles will emanate from Energy Barriers.

Indestructibility
-------------------

Energy Barriers cannot be broken, moved, or collected in any normal way by players in Survival Mode, nor can they be destroyed by explosions.

Shielding
-----------

Energy Barriers will spawn on all four sides of the boss portal room in the Wight Fortress, where the eye that will teleport them to the boss is found. When a player or mob touches an Energy Barrier from the side, they will take 1 damage () and be flung backwards, and a maniacal laugh will be heard. How far they are flung back increases based on how many individual Energy Barrier blocks they touched.

In order to break the Energy Barrier, the player must attempt to pass through it while holding the fully assembled Shockwave Sword. Once they do so, all Energy Barriers protecting the room will instantly shatter, granting access to the eye.

The Energy Barriers found in the Sludgeon cannot be destroyed, even if the player is wielding a Shockwave Sword.
