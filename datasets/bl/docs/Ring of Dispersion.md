How to Equip
--------------

The Ring can be right-clicked to equip it onto an invisible slot beside the hotbar. Note that only two rings can be equipped at a time.

The Ring of Dispersion can also be equipped through the Radial Equipment Menu, which is opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any ring equipped onto the player (in red text) as well as rings in their inventory (in green text). A ring can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management.

Effects
---------

While equipped, the Ring of Dispersion will allow the wearer to temporarily pass through blocks while sneaking. As the player moves into a block, an overlay will gradually close over the player's screen, reducing their vision to a small peep-hole. While inside a block, a red vignette will slowly appear around the screen until the player exits. If they remain, the player will be teleported back to where they started after about 15 seconds. The same also happens if the player stops sneaking. Jumping is possible while wearing the ring, allowing the player to effectively climb up and through walls.

Note that the player can still be damaged normally in the dispersion state, and they do not turn invisible. Entities, particles, shaders, and other effects are also not rendered while in a block, and anything more than ~5 blocks away is completely dark.

While in use, the Ring's durability will gradually decrease, and must be recharged when depleted. This can be done by right-clicking with the ring, consuming a chunk of the player's experience. The amount of XP needed to fully replenish the ring depends on how much durability is missing.
