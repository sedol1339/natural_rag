The **Portal Tree** is a magically imbued tree that provides access to The Betweenlands. It can be grown by right-clicking on any Sapling with the Swamp Talisman obtained from the Druid Circle, providing that there is a sufficient amount of flat space around the Sapling.

The Portal Tree is the size of a regular Weedwood Tree, featuring a thick, hollow trunk with supporting roots and branches, and a wide, bushy canopy. On each of the four sides of the trunk is a luminescent, two-by-one portal to the Betweenlands, framed with an intricate design. Once on the other side, another Portal Tree will be created in the Betweenlands and the player will spawn inside it. This allows them to travel to and from the dimension.

Note that the Portal Tree will never generate on its own in certain "unsafe" biomes within The Overworld. Which biomes are classified as unsafe can be adjusted in the config.

Composition
-------------

The Portal Tree consists of:

* Portal Frame, as the bark, root, branch and portal frame block
* Weedwood, as the inner trunk base block on whole trees
* Weedwood Leaves, as the leaf block on whole trees

Tree Portal
-------------

In the case that a newly generated Portal Tree created from going to or from the Betweenlands does not have enough space, the tree will be replaced by a smaller Tree Portal. This is a four-by-three frame of Portal Frame blocks with a single portal in its center, and a small base of more Portal Frames below it.

A Tree Portal can also be created by building the same four-by-three frame of Portal Frame blocks, and right-clicking on the base of the frame's center with the Swamp Talisman to ignite the portal. Whatever Portal Frame blocks were used will be rearranged into the usual pattern surrounding each portal on the tree. This can prove useful if you lose or destroy one or all of the original portals and still have some of the materials.

Both naturally generated and artificially created Tree Portals will still appear with a map icon on an Amate Map.

Portal Linking
----------------

Two Tree Portals can be linked together between any other dimension and The Betweenlands using the Swamp Talisman. This requires that both portals are within 1500 blocks relative of each other in terms of the coordinates in both dimensions. Two linked Tree Portals will always transport players and other entities to each other, regardless of what portal they originally transported to.

First, right-click on the initial Tree Portal (whether it be the main Portal Tree structure or a smaller portal) with the Swamp Talisman, turning it into a Linked Swamp Talisman with the portal's coordinates stored within (visible as part of its tooltip). Then, go to the other Tree Portal you want to link it with and right-click it with the linked talisman.

A Tree Portal cannot be linked to itself, nor to another portal in the same dimension, and one of the portals must be in The Betweenlands. Additionally, right-clicking with a linked talisman anywhere, no matter whether it successfully links the portals or not, will cause it to become unlinked again. The maximum portal linking distance can be adjusted in the config.
