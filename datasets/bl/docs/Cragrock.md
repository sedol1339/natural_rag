Obtaining

### Purifying Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cragrock** | **Mossy Cragrock Top** or **Mossy Cragrock Bottom** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

### Generation
All forms of Cragrock generate in large patches in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes, and as Cragrock Spires in Deep Waters biomes, with Mossy Cragrock Tops on the topmost parts and Mossy Cragrock Bottoms just underneath. They can also be found as part of Cragrock Towers.

Normal Cragrock and Mossy Cragrock Bottoms can be found as part of Idol Head Statues.

Properties
------------

### Plant Support
Mossy Cragrock Tops and Bottoms support the placement and growth of basic plants.

### Spreading
Mossy Cragrock Tops and Bottoms will spread to nearby normal Cragrock over time. Cragrock blocks on the same layer as the spreading block will become Mossy Cragrock Tops, whereas those directly below the spreading block will become Mossy Cragrock Bottoms.

### Events
All placed forms of Cragrock will take on alternative textures during the Spook seasonal event. Placed Mossy Cragrock Tops and Bottoms will additionally take on alternative textures during the Winter seasonal event.
