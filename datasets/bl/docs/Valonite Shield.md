Blocking
----------

Like any shield, the Valonite Shield can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player does not receive any knockback upon blocking. The shield can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

The Valonite Shield has the unique ability to reflect a small portion of the initial damage an attacker deals back upon them while blocking. In the case of certain projectiles, it can completely reflect them, causing them to be fired back at the same velocity towards their source.

The Valonite Shield also uniquely grants the player the ability to charge into their enemies by holding down shift while blocking with it, then letting go of shift. The player will speed forward, dealing damage to any mobs that they contact from the front and knocking them back greatly. The longer the shield is charged before releasing, the further the player will charge before stopping, up to a maximum of 2 seconds. Note that doing this causes the player to consume hunger at a much faster than usual rate.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Valonite Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Valonite Shield** | Damaged **Valonite Shield** + Sulfur (7-16) + Life Crystal (12-36% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Valonite Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
