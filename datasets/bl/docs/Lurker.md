Description
-------------

Lurkers resemble crocodiles, with paddle-shaped limbs, streamlined bodies, and finned tails. They also have wounds on their bodies.

Behavior
----------

Lurkers swim gracefully, but will wade onto land if necessary in order to chase their prey. They will not attack players unless provoked, at which point, all nearby Lurkers will come and aid that provoked Lurker. The only exception to this is if the player is afflicted with Stench, in which case all Lurkers will attack on sight. When damaged, they take no knockback. They will also prey on Anglers, Anadia, Jellyfish, Freshwater Urchins, and Dragonflies, often leaping out of the water when hunting the latter.
