The **Infuser** is a utility block that infuses ingredients with Aspects together, such as Ground Items, Aspect Vials and/or Aspectrus Fruit, and turns them into Infusion Buckets.

Properties
------------

### Infusing
To begin the process of infusing, the Infuser must be placed directly above Smoldering Peat. Smoldering Peat can be created in the Betweenlands by placing or dropping Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, or Thorns (or the corresponding dropped Plant Item or Ground Item), then holding down right-click on it with an Octine Ingot. The ingot will cause the plant to slowly build up flame until it turns into a fire block, without consuming the ingot in the process. Next you douce the fire, and you will see a steam effect rise from the floor. It is advised to light the fire on an infinitely fire-sustaining block, such as Peat. Additionally, a Fire Charge can be used, of which will be consumed, but will still create fire nonetheless.

Next, Swamp Water must be put inside the Infuser, using either a Weedwood or Syrmorite Bucket. Up to three buckets worth of water can be added. An Infuser can also collect rainwater from the Betweenlands over time, as long as it is exposed to the sky during the Heavy Rain event. As long as the fire below is lit, the water will slowly heat up to a boiling temperature, but will cool down twice as fast if the fire is extinguished. It is recommended that all intended water buckets be put into the Infuser at the same time, because each bucket added after the water has already begun heating will reduce its current temperature by a third.

At this point, ingredients can start being added by right-clicking them into the Infuser, and can be removed by shift right-clicking it. Any combination of up to six Ground Items, Aspect Vials and Aspectrus Fruit may be used, but the Aspects these ingredients contain will determine if the resulting Infusion Bucket will distill into valid Infusions or Aspect Vials. These Aspects are in most cases randomized per world seed and are not always known to the player immediately, meaning that which ingredients are used to make the same Infusion will likely vary.

The water inside the Infuser will signify it has reached boiling temperature by bubbling and emitting steam. This is around the time when it will begin infusing ingredients together, and the ingredients currently inside will no longer be retrievable. As the mixture infuses, the liquid inside will slowly change colour, from a lighter green to darker indigo. If the Aspect combination of the ingredients inside is invalid, the liquid will instead immediately steam up, make a bubbling sound, and turn a bright purple-pink colour.

It is important that the player continuously stir the Infuser by right-clicking it in order to keep the liquid from evaporating. For every 30 seconds that go by without any stirring, one bucket worth of the liquid will evaporate. If the liquid is completely evaporated, a dangerous Shallowbreath will spawn above the Infuser, which will proceed to attack the player. The process of stirring can be automated by right-clicking the Infuser with a Life Crystal, which will stir the brew on its own every 30 seconds as long as it has enough charge. The Life Crystal will be drained of charge over time as it as used.

If the combination of Aspects from the ingredients in the Infuser was valid, the mixture will eventually finish infusing, signified by a drastic change in the liquid's colour to match its infusion colour, a burst of steam and a bubbling completion sound. This is when the brew can be collected by shift right-clicking the Infuser with Weedwood or Syrmorite Buckets. Make sure to collect the brew quickly, for if it is left uncollected for too long it will become a brown colour and be considered "overdone."

The resulting Infusion Buckets, when distilled in an Alembic, will yield a certain type of Infusion depending on the Aspect combination used. The number of Infusions it yields depends on the total amount of all of the Aspects that were in the original ingredients. Their potency and duration depends on the concentration of certain Aspects used, which vary with each Infusion type.

If the Aspect combination is invalid, if the mixture is collected before it is finished infusing, or if it is collected after it becomes overdone, the resulting Infusion Buckets will instead yield Aspect Vials when distilled in the Alembic. One Aspect Vial will be yielded per Aspect present in the mixture, and its amount depends on the total amount of that particular Aspect in the original ingredients.

### Infusion Aspect Combinations
The following is a list of all Aspect combinations that utilize the Infuser to create the Infusion Buckets needed to make Infusions.

Aspects colored in red text act as "strength" modifiers, meaning the more of that aspect is in the combination, the more potent its effect is. Aspects colored in blue text act as "duration" modifiers, meaning the more of that aspect is in the combination, the longer lasting its effect is.
