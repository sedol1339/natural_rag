**Tar Beasts** are hulking monsters that spawn within pools of Tar in Sludge Plains and rarely Swamplands biomes. They also spawn from Tar Beast Spawners in Tar Pool Dungeons. If a Wight contacts Tar, it will transform into a Tar Beast after a few seconds.

Description
-------------

Tar Beasts are hunched-over humanoids composed of tar with red eyes, an elongated right forelimb, and dripping faces. Their texture is animated like flowing tar, and they drag themselves to move using their arm. When damaged they take no knockback. In addition to dealing basic melee damage, Tar Beasts have two special attacks which they periodically use:

* They cause a tar explosion. A brief transparent image of themselves will appear around them right before causing the explosion, which briefly sucks a player's view point inwards, causes massive amounts of damage (enough to kill the player in one explosion at point blank range), and inflicts Slowness II () for a few seconds.
* They pull you towards them to suffocate you. A constantly pulsating transparent image will be visible around them a couple seconds before emitting black particles. They then attempt to pull you directly into themselves, which causes the screen to become black with tar and causes suffocation damage to the player, for a few seconds.

Both of these attacks create sound effects. In addition, running into the Tar Beast at any time will cause the screen to fill with Tar, blinding the player.

Tar Beasts have a chance to spawn applied with a random Amulet, which will give it Middle Gem Circle benefits depending on the type applied. This amulet will not drop upon their death.

Strategy
----------

Tar Beasts are extremely difficult mobs to face even when prepared, and one should take fighting them seriously. Try to keep a reasonable distance from the beast and shoot it with arrows from a Weedwood Bow. Its explosion attack is strong but can be blocked entirely with a shield, while its suction attack can be avoided as long as you aren't too close; and both of these attacks have brief warning signs to show they are about to happen so you can prepare. Another thing to note is that a Shockwave Sword makes it very easy to keep distance between you and the tar beast. Lastly, Never fight more than one at a time, however; that is sure to bring you to a swift end.
