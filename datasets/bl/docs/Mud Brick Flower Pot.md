The **Mud Brick Flower Pot** is a small decorative block. It has a regular variant and a light-producing Candle variant. In addition to being crafted, the normal variant can also be found as part of Sludge Plains Ruins, and the Candle variant can be found next to Simulacra (toggled on by default) and in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon (toggled off by default).

Crafting Recipes
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mud Brick Flower Pot** | Mud Brick (3) |  |
| Mud Brick Flower Pot with Candle | **Mud Brick Flower Pot** + Sulfur Torch |  |

Placement
-----------

Mud Brick Flower Pots can only be placed on the top of most blocks. Breaking the block a Mud Brick Flower Pot is sitting on will cause the pot to break as well.

Potting
---------

The Mud Brick Flower Pot functions similarly to the vanilla Flower Pot in that it can be right-clicked with certain plants to place them inside.

The Mud Brick Flower Pot can hold all of the plants that the vanilla Flower Pot can, as well as the following Betweenlands plants:

* Arrow Arum
* Black Hat Mushroom, Bladderwort Flower, Blue Eyed Grass, Blue Iris, Boneset, Bottlebrush Grass, Bulb-Capped Mushroom, Button Bush
* Cattail, Cave Grass, Copper Iris
* Dead Weedwood Bush
* Edge Leaf, Edge Moss, Edge Shrooms
* Flathead Mushroom
* Marsh Hibiscus, Marsh Mallow, Milkweed
* Nettle
* Pale Grass, Pickerel Weed
* Rotbulb
* Shoots, Sludgecreep, Soft Rush, Swamp Plant, Swamp Tallgrass
* Tall Sludgecreep
* Venus Fly Trap

A potted Mud Brick Flower Pot can be right-clicked to remove the plant from the pot and give it back to the player.

Potted plants will take on coloration determined on the biome. This reflects the same color if it was placed in said biome.

Candle
--------

A Mud Brick Flower Pot with Candle can be crafted, or created by right-clicking a placed empty Mud Brick Flower Pot with a Sulfur Torch. This turns the pot into a light source that can be right-clicked to toggle the light on and off. The pot cannot hold plants in this form.

The Mud Brick Flower Pot with Candle can be left-clicked to take the candle out and retrieve the Sulfur Torch. The pot and torch will drop separately if the block the pot is placed on is removed.

Providing Light
-----------------

When lit, Mud Brick Flower Pots with Candles provide a light level of 13, which is slightly less light than both vanilla Torches and Sulfur Torches. They will not burn out in The Betweenlands, nor do they become extinguished when exposed to rain from the Heavy Rain event.
