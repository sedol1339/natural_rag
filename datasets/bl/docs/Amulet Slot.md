Adding Slots
--------------

When right-clicked, the Amulet Slot will apply an additional "slot" for Amulets to the player that used it and consume 5 uses. These slots allow you to equip multiple Amulets at once and maximize power. However, there can only be a maximum of two additional amulet slots on a player at a time in Survival Mode, and these slots will disappear should the player die, requiring the use of the item again.

The Amulet Slot can also be applied to player-defending mobs (Tar Minions, tamed Harlequin Toads, tamed Emberlings, and friendly Small Spirit Tree Faces) by right-clicking them with the Amulet Slot, consuming only 2 uses. This allows one to equip multiple Amulets on a single mob, although the same limits apply to them as to players.- NOTE: although this feature is intended, it is not currently implemented. this only works for Tarminions at the moment.
