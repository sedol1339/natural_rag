Usage
-------

Right clicking on a block with a Staff of the Shadow Walker causes blocks in front of the player to become intangible for 12 seconds, allowing the player to pass through. Passing through intangible blocks afflicts the player with Blindness and Slowness II. The Staff has a conical range of 15 and a 12 second cooldown between each use.

The Staff cannot be used to pass through blocks protected by a ward, such as those in the Sludgeon, Wight Fortress, Spirit Tree, Cragrock Tower, and Matriarch Nest.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Staff of the Shadow Walker.
