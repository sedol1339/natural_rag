Flowering
-----------

Nettles naturally go through cycles of flowering, blooming into Flowered Nettles over time and eventually withering back into regular Nettles.

Stinging
----------

A player or non-Betweenlands mob will take 1 damage () every 0.5 seconds while being in direct contact with a Nettle or Flowered Nettle. This damage can be reduced by Armour or entirely negated with a Toughskin Elixir.

Betweenlands mobs do not take damage from Nettles or Flowered Nettles.

Collection
------------

Nettles and Flowered Nettles must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Nettle Leaf, which can then be ground into Ground Nettle.

Growing
---------

Nettles and Flowered Nettles will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Nettles can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Nettles have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Flowered Nettles have a compost process time of 7 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Nettles and Flowered Nettles will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.
