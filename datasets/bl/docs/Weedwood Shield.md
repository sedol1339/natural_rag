Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Weedwood Shield** | Any Weedwood Log (6) + Reed Rope |  |
| Living Weedwood Shield | **Weedwood Shield** + Small Animated Spirit Tree Face Mask |  |

Crypt Crawlers
----------------

Some Crypt Crawlers can spawn equipped with a regular Weedwood Shield. The shield has a chance to drop when the Crypt Crawler is killed.

Blocking
----------

Like any shield, both types of Weedwood Shield can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player receives a significant amount of knockback upon blocking. The shields can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

Both Weedwood Shields have a chance to catch on fire upon blocking a fire damage-inflicting attack, draining their durability greatly over time for a few seconds.

The Living Weedwood Shield, uniquely, has the ability to shoot damaging sap spit balls at nearby hostile mobs while blocking. One spit ball will be fired every 1.5 to 3 seconds until the mob is killed or out of range. The Small Spirit Tree Face on the front of the shield also makes idle sounds while blocking and glows upon spitting.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, both types of damaged Weedwood Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Weedwood Shield** | Any damaged **Weedwood Shield** + Sulfur (3-6) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, both types of Weedwood Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to corresponding **Weedwood Shield** | Any **Weedwood Shield** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Corrosion
-----------

Both types of Weedwood Shield do not corrode.
