Description
-------------

Shamblers are short, alien-like creatures that stand upon two stout legs. They possess a dark green coloration, a tail that is normally curled up, and a large gaping mouth that is usually covered by four teeth which meet over it. This mouth houses a long, fleshy tongue, which itself is tipped with another toothed mouth at its end that it uses to capture its prey - when it deploys this tongue, its tail will also briefly extend. Their heads also feature a crest that angles upwards towards its back.

Shamblers are aggressive to players as well as to Frogs, Dragonflies, Mire Snails, Blood Snails, and Chiromaws which they will hunt. Upon spotting a target, a Shambler will open its mouth and extend its tongue, grabbing its victim and causing them to "ride" the Shambler (similar to riding a mount such as a Harlequinn Toad). However, the Shambler cannot be directed by the captured mob, and instead will continuously deal contact damage to it until it or the Shambler has been killed or until its target escapes its jaws. While captured, players may still attack the Shambler to damage it. Players can escape its grasp by sneaking to dismount, though the Shambler will still be able to deal melee damage to the player. Its jaws will remain open after the player has escaped, unless the player is at a sufficient distance from the Shambler, in which case they will close, allowing it to deploy its tongue again.

Strategy
----------

The best means to kill a Shambler is often to shoot them from a distance before they have a chance to grab onto the player. If one does, they can then be quickly dispatched using melee. As the damage they deal is low, the main danger comes from being dragged into another group of enemies, especially in the Sludgeon. The Shambler's erratic thrashing movements can make attacking difficult, so they should be a priority. Holding down the sneak key will allow the player to instantly escape from the Shambler's grab attack, preventing it from pulling the player into melee range.

When players are grabbed, the Shambler's health can be viewed the same way a normal mount's health can, in place of the hunger bar.
