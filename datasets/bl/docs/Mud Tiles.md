Mud Tiles ingame

**Mud Tiles** are craftable building blocks. They have a normal variant and an uncraftable Cracked variant. In addition to being crafted, both variants can be found as part of the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon, and the Cracked variant is left behind upon breaking or shearing a Puffshroom.
