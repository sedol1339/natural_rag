Crafting Recipe

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Climbing Rope** | Reed Rope or Hanger or Seeded Hanger (3) |  |

Climbing
----------

Climbing Rope can be placed anywhere on a solid block that has no other block directly under it, and will always be placed on the underside of the block. It can then be placed downward and can be climbed, in a similar manner to a vanilla or Weedwood Ladder.

Once placed, additional Climbing Rope from the inventory can be right-clicked onto any placed piece to add additional pieces below it, extending the rope downwards without having to place each piece from directly below the lowest one. This rope can also be retracted and recollected by shift-right clicking on any piece between the first and the last with an empty hand.

Compostability
----------------

Climbing Rope has a compost process time of 4 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 3. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
