Particles
-----------

Small water particles will drip from Weeping Blues, as if they are literally weeping.

Collection
------------

When harvested normally, Weeping Blues drop 1-2 Weeping Blue Petals, which can be consumed to restore decay.

Weeping Blues themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Growing
---------

Weeping Blues will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Weeping Blues have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 15. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
