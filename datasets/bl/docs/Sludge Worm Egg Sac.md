**Sludge Worm Egg Sacs** can be found in the third layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon, are spawned by the boss of the Pit of Decay, and are laid by Large Sludge Worms.

They are also occasionally dropped when Worm Holes are "killed".

Obtaining/Behavior
--------------------

Sludge Worm Egg Sacs can be collected with a Net, but if the player gets too close they will hatch into Small Sludge Worms. However, if the player is sneaking, the egg sacs will not hatch.
