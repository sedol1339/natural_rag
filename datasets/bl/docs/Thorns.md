Thorns ingame

Placement
-----------

Thorns can only be placed on the side of most blocks. Breaking a higher part of the Thorn vine will break all parts below it that are not connected to a side block as well.

Growth
--------

Thorns naturally grow down from blocks like Vines, and do not require additional side blocks to do so.

Pricking
----------

A player or non-Betweenlands mob will take 1 damage () every 0.5 seconds while being in direct contact with Thorns. This damage can be reduced by Armour or entirely negated with a Toughskin Elixir.

Betweenlands mobs do not take damage from Thorns.

Collection
------------

Thorns must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Thorn Branch, which can then be ground into Ground Thorns.

Compostability
----------------

Thorns have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Igniting
----------

Thorns can be used to create fire by holding right-click on either their placed or dropped form with an Octine Ingot. Thorns that are adjacent to or on a Block of Octine will also catch fire, although this fire will not spread to further Thorn blocks.
