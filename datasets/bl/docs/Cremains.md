Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Cremains drop from Ash Sprites upon death.

Uses
------

### Censing
Cremains can be used as an effect source for the Censer. When fueled, this will cause any player or mob in a 13x13x6 area around the Censer, including the player who used it, to take 1 damage () every 0.5 seconds and to be set on fire. The effect range is indicated by a thick black cloud. Additionally, mobs killed by the incinerating effect will drop 0-2 Cremains instead of their usual drops. Each Cremains is worth 2 minutes and 30 seconds of effect time.
