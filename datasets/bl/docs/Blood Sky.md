Effects
---------

Swamp Hags gain enhanced spawn rates and are much more dangerous during the event

Tunnel Entrances containing Crypt Crawlers generate during the event

When the Blood Sky event first starts, a deep, echoing roar sound will play throughout the dimension. Immediately after this and for the duration of the event, the sky will be shifted into a reddish-orange hue using shaders, with a glow-like effect that occasionally pulsates from southeast of the player. Light levels will also generally appear darker. The normal ambient sounds for the entire dimension will be replaced by an alternative, eerie ambient track, and Music will not play during the event either.

Several major changes related to mobs will occur during the Blood Sky event:

* Fireflies will spawn more commonly than usual on the surface of the dimension, and can spawn regardless of sky light.
* Sporelings that spawn *during* the event will spawn with Splodeshrooms on top of them. While the Splodeshroom is intact, they will run *towards* players instead of away from them.
* Swamp Hags and Peat Mummies will also spawn more commonly than usual on the surface of the dimension, and can spawn in *any* biome. However, spawning locations for Peat Mummies are still restricted to 3x3x2 areas of Mud or Peat that are *not* directly under liquid or other blocks.
  + Additionally, *all* Swamp Hags and Peat Mummies that spawn *during* the event will receive increases to their speed and damage. Specifically, Swamp Hags will move 60% faster and deal twice as much damage compared to their base speed and damage values, whereas Peat Mummies will move 37.5% faster and deal about 33% (or 1/3) more damage than usual.
* Tunnel Entrances will generate randomly over time in the ground throughout the surface landscape. These entrances will start spawning Crypt Crawlers when a player comes near, and will spawn several before disappearing.

### Prediction
The Wind Chime forecast visual for the Blood Sky event

The Blood Sky event can be predicted up to 5 minutes before it starts by a Wind Chime, or up to 10 minutes before if it is attuned to the event.

When forecasting, a forecast visual will emanate from the Wind Chime, and a unique chime jingle sound will play:
