Usage
-------

The instructions to use it are on the item itself. Forward and space makes you ascend, backward and space makes you descend, shift detaches you, and while in the air you can use the directional keys to swing around. The hook can also be ripped when segments land too far apart from one another, causing it to lose segments. It is also used to craft the Draeton Anchor Upgrade.
