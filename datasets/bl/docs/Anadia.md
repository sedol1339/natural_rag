Appearance
------------

Anadia come in a variety of sizes, 4 mob colors, and have 27 model variations made from a combination of traits.

The colors are determined by where or how the Anadia spawned - Green Anadia spawn in Patchy Islands biomes, Purple in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes, and Silver in Deep Waters biomes, whereas Brown Anadia only spawn if a different color could not be identified.

Each Anadia is named after its traits with a 3 part name consisting of their body type (Skittish, Slender, Stubby,) tail type (Cliptail, Longtail, Fantail,) and head type (Grazer, Prowler, Thumphead.) This also affects their loot in the Trimming Table.

### Catching
A Weedwood Fishing Rod and Net is required to catch an Anadia. A fishing minigame takes place once an Anadia has been hooked. Victory comes if you escape the crab and get the Anadia to the right side of the bar.

Processing
------------

Once an Anadia is caught, it can be Smoked, processed in a Trimming Table, or released like other critters.

### Rotting
Anadia in item form will rot over time. This is shown through the “status” tooltip, in which the Anadia will progress through “Freshly Caught,” “Starting to Ripen,” “Getting Smelly,” and finally, “Rotten.” The Anadia can be Smoked or contained as a mob to preserve it. Once the Anadia is Rotten, it is considered “dead” and can no longer be placed back into the world. Rotten Anadia only give Anadia Remains in the Trimming Table. Having a rotten Anadia in the inventory will also afflict Stench on the player.
