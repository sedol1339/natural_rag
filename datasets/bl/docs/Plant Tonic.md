Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plant Tonic** | Any Bucket (Swamp Water) + Ball of Sap |  |

Removing Decay
----------------

Plant Tonic can be right-clicked on composted, decayed Dug Swamp Dirt or Dug Swamp Grass to remove the decay from the block and a 5x5 area of decayed blocks around it, curing any decayed crops on them in the process. It can also be directly right-clicked on a decayed crop above the compost block it is growing on to cure the crop back to normal. It has three uses and when depleted will leave behind the empty bucket.

Do note that the revert of decay is only a temporary change, and the composted block or crop can decay again.

Censer
--------

When applied to the Censer, it will return the bucket, consuming the entire content of said bucket. When used like this, it prevents crop decay in a medium area and will also cure decay at the cost of fuel.
