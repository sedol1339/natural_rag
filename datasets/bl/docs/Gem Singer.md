The sound ripple

The **Gem Singer** is a special item that can be found as Loot from chests in Shrines, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress. It is used to locate Middle Gems and Life Crystals more easily.

Locating Ores
---------------

Right-clicking with a Gem Singer will cause it to begin tracking the nearest Middle Gem Ore or Life Crystal Ore if it is within a large range around the player. If an ore is found, the location of the ore will be pinpointed after a varying delay by a sound ripple that can be seen through blocks and emits a sound in response to the initial sound made upon using the Gem Singer. The sound ripple will be visible for a few seconds before disappearing.

As soon as it finds an ore, the Gem Singer will receive an enchanted glint and continually track that particular ore as long as it is within range. Subsequent uses of the Gem Singer will reveal the sound ripple again, and the sound it emits will grow louder the closer the player is to the ore. The delay between the use of the Gem Singer and the appearance of the ripple will also grow shorter as the player gets closer to the ore. Note that the Gem Singer will take durability damage with every use, and there is a three-second cooldown between uses.

Shift right-clicking a Gem Singer that is tracking an ore will cause it to stop tracking that ore. Right-clicking the Gem Singer again will cause it to track a different ore within range instead.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Gem Singer.
