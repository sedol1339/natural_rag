*"I had been in one of the expansive caverns underground when I came across a pool of black, liquid tar, with some ruins around it. It was the perfect place to find submerged loot! Only, when I approached it, the tar suddenly rose into the air and molded into a red-eyed beast before my eyes."*

**Tar Pool Dungeons** are small, somewhat rare structures that generate in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers. They are small, dome-shaped caves with a pool of Tar in their center. The pool contains Tar-solidified Pots with loot at its bottom, but also contains a Tar Beast spawner.

Due to the nature of Tar Beasts, this dungeon may prove very difficult to conquer. It is advised to empty the Tar pool before attempting to destroy the spawner and claim the items in the Pots.

Tar Pool Dungeons have a world location that identifies the area they take up, as well as a title that appears briefly to players who approach them.
