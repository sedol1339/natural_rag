### Loot
Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrows can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, and Underground Ruins.
* Urns of Chance in Sludge Plains Ruins.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues and Shrines.

Properties
------------

### Shooting
Like vanilla Arrows, Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrows can be shot from any Bow, including a Weedwood Bow or Predator Bow. The velocity they are shot at depends on how far back the bow is pulled, as well as how corroded it is. The arrows deal damage based on their velocity to whatever entity they hit. If they do not hit an entity, they will instead stick into the block they land on and can then be picked up, but will eventually despawn if left untouched.

Additionally, shot Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrows inflict the  Poison III effect upon entities they hit for 10 seconds.

Uses
------

### Lightning Effects
If Betweenlands Lightning strikes one or more dropped Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.
