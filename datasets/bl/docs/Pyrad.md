Description
-------------

Pyrads appear as a sort of 'nature spirit' with glowing eyes and markings, runic plates, and a staff on its back.

When initially spawned around Giant Weedwood Trees, Pyrads are in a 'sleeping' state, resting on the ground, and do not attack. However, if the sky light in the dimension is low enough - specifically, when the Rift event is *not* active, *or* only during the night if it *is* active - all Pyrads will be awake and hostile to the player. When the sky light is bright enough, they will not wake immediately upon being hit if dealt minor blows, but will awake after taking significant damage. They also have a chance to wake up when breaking a block from the Giant Weedwood Tree they spawned from. Note that Pyrads spawned by Monster Spawners are immediately active, regardless of the Rift status.

Once awoken, Pyrads use a leaf tornado effect similar to that granted by the Ring of Ascent to lift themselves three or four blocks off the ground, and become aggressive. When attacking, they glow (using a green shader effect) and charge their attack for a few seconds before launching three inaccurate spreads of between one and five Pyrad Flame projectiles in the target's general direction. These fireballs are not affected by gravity, deal contact damage, and can set players, mobs and blocks on fire.

After a while, if there are no players or other targets nearby, the Pyrad will return to its sleeping state.

They have a custom death animation when killed, causing them to 'deactivate' and drop to the ground, sinking some into whatever ground they have come into contact with, before vanishing in a small burst of leaves.

Strategy
----------

Pyrads can be dangerous due to their ability to shoot multiple fireballs at once, allowing them to shower a large area. Using a shield is highly recommended, as it can effectively mitigate all damage from their flames. If you don't have a shield, try hiding behind blocks whenever they shoot to avoid the projectiles, and put out any fires you come across to minimize taken damage. This can be difficult if there are multiple Pyrads nearby, as some can shoot while others are charging. Another method may be to bring a bucket of water to put out the fire should you be set alight.
