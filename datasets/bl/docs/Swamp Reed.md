Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Swamp Reeds generate in the water in Patchy Islands, Coarse Islands, and Raised Isles biomes, and on land in Swamplands biomes.

Properties
------------

### Coloration
Swamp Reeds take on different grass colors depending on what biome they are in. The grass color is:

* #6BC44E in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #627017 in Marsh biomes
* #1FC66D to  #1FC63D in Patchy Islands biomes
* #5B3522 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #2AFF00 to  #50A040 in Swamplands biomes

### Particles
Small particles resembling mosquitoes will occasionally float around Swamp Reeds.

### Growing
Swamp Reeds will naturally grow upwards, and grow a third faster when underwater. They can grow up to four blocks high on land, but if underwater can grow infinitely up to the surface of the water, as well as three additional blocks into the air.

### Events
Placed Swamp Reeds will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events, which are not affected by biome grass colors.

### Breaking
Breaking a lower part of a Swamp Reed growth will break all parts above it as well.

Drops
-------

When broken, Swamp Reeds drop a **Swamp Reed** item. The blocks themselves cannot be collected.

Item Properties
-----------------

### Planting
Swamp Reed items can be used to plant Swamp Reeds on plant-supporting blocks that are either in or directly adjacent to Swamp Water, as well as directly above themselves.

Uses
------

### Compostability
Swamp Reed items can be composted in a Compost Bin. They have a compost process time of 4 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 3. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
