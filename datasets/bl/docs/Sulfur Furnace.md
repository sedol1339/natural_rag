How to Use
------------

The smelting interface can be accessed by right-clicking the Sulfur Furnace. Smelting works nearly identically to smelting in a vanilla Furnace, featuring the usual input, fuel, and output slots to cook or process items into new ones. However, the fuel sources that are used will likely be different when working in the Betweenlands.

The following is a list of all items from the Betweenlands that can be used as fuel in a Sulfur Furnace, as well as the number of items each is capable of smelting before running out.

| Sulfur Furnace Fuels | |
| --- | --- |
| **Fuel** | **Smelts per Fuel** |
| Bulb-Capped Mushroom Cap | 1.5 |
| Bulb-Capped Mushroom Stalk | 1.5 |
| Compost Bin | 1.5 |
| Fences | 1.5 |
| Fence Gates | 1.5 |
| Gecko Cage | 1.5 |

While smelting, the Sulfur Furnace will emit light and produce fire, as well as make a crackling fire sound.

In addition, there is a new, optional left slot in the Sulfur Furnace interface. This slot is capable of accepting Limestone Flux and gives Octine Ore and Syrmorite Ore smelted in the furnace a chance to yield two ingots instead of just one. One Limestone Flux item will always be consumed from this slot whenever the ore is smelted, and the duplication will not work with any other smelted items.
