Spirit Tree Logs ingame

**Spirit Tree Logs** are the log and root blocks of both natural and sapling-grown Spirit Trees. They normally do not appear carved, but occasionally take on a carved texture.

Spirit Tree Faces
-------------------

Spirit Tree Logs support the existence of Spirit Tree Faces. The logs of naturally generated Spirit Trees are inhabited by a multitude of hostile Small Spirit Tree Faces that attack the player, as well as a central Large Spirit Tree Face that acts as the tree's main conscience. The logs of trees grown from Spirit Tree Saplings will be inhabited by a single, friendly Small Spirit Tree Face that attacks hostile mobs.

If the block a Small Spirit Tree Face is on is somehow removed, or if it otherwise ends up in an invalid position, it will drop to the ground and attempt to teleport to a nearby Spirit Tree Log.

Death
-------

If the Large Spirit Tree Face of a naturally generated Spirit Tree is killed, the tree will begin to die. The Spirit Tree Logs of the tree will slowly convert into Spreading Rotten Bark, causing the Spirit Tree Leaves of the tree to decay as well.

Fuel
------

Spirit Tree Logs can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per log.
