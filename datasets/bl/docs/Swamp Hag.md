**Swamp Hags** are undead mobs that spawn occasionally in Swamplands, Patchy Islands, Coarse Islands, and Raised Isles biomes, as well as more commonly anywhere underground in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers. They will spawn at a heavily increased rate and in all surface Betweenlands biomes during a Blood Sky, and also spawn from Monster Spawners in Shrines, Underground Oases, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.

Description
-------------

Swamp Hags are about 2.5 blocks tall, and appear as skeletal creatures with scarred and overgrown limbs and with glowing yellow eyes. They stagger when they walk, as an added horror factor. They act like the average hostile mob, and deal average melee damage. In addition, with each hit they have a chance not to take knockback.

They will bang on doors that are in the way of their target; if the world is in Hard difficulty, they will eventually succeed in breaking down the door.

When spawned during the Blood Sky event, they move faster and deal twice as much damage, making them significantly more dangerous.

Swamp Hags get faster and stronger deeper underground, similar to their Blood Sky buff.

Wights can possess nearby Swamp Hags and turn them into "turrets". The Wight will send out flying soul projectiles that can pass through blocks to attack the player or nearby mobs.

Swamp Hags have a chance to spawn applied with a random Amulet, which will give it Middle Gem Circle benefits depending on the type applied. This amulet will not drop upon their death.

Swamp Hags can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Hag Hacker.

Strategy
----------

Individual Swamp Hags and even small groups of them are quite easy to handle; their AI is essentially that of a vanilla zombie, and their stats are only slightly higher. Large groups of them can be a different story however, especially if they sneak up to you from behind; bring a shield in this case, ideally an octine one, as that makes groups far easier. Just be on the lookout for those appearances and you'll be fine.
