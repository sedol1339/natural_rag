| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

### Crypt Crawlers
Crypt Crawlers can sometimes spawn equipped with a Bone Sword or Bone Axe. The equipment has a chance to drop from the Crypt Crawler if killed by a player.

Properties
------------

### Usage
Bone Tools have similar base damage, attack speed and mining speed to stone tools. Like all Betweenlands tools, Bone Tools deal more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools. The Bone Pickaxe is the first available pickaxe capable of mining Octine Ore and Syrmorite Ore.

Unlike stone tools, there is no Bone Hoe, as farming in the Betweenlands involves Compost instead.

### Repairing
Like most other equipment with durability, damaged Bone Tools can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Bone Tool** | Any damaged **Bone Tool** + Sulfur (4-8) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

### Corrosion
Bone Tools are made in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having them in your inventory will cause them to start corroding; using and swinging them as well as being in water will increase their rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases their damage output and mining effectiveness.

A corroded Bone Tool can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from corresponding **Bone Tool** | Any corroded and uncoated **Bone Tool** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A tool can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats corresponding **Bone Tool** (75 points per piece) | Any **Bone Tool** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded tool can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a tool that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from corresponding **Bone Tool** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Bone Tool** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

### Middle Gems
As with most equipment, Bone Tools can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using them. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the sword, and in the tooltip of all tools. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to corresponding **Bone Tool** | Any **Bone Tool** + Any Middle Gem |  |
