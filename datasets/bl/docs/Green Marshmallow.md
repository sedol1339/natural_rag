Properties

### Consuming
When eaten, Green Marshmallows restore 4 hunger and 1.2 saturation. They also grant the  Speed II effect for 20 seconds.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Green Marshmallows have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Green Marshmallows only restore 1 hunger () when eaten, a third of the original hunger value (rounded down).

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.
