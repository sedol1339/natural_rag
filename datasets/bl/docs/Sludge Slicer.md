Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sludge Slicer** (20 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (12% charge) |  |

Attacking
-----------

Against most mobs, the Sludge Slicer only deals its minimum base damage; however, it will instantly kill any Sludges and Smoll Sludges it is used against, making it very useful. Like all Betweenlands tools, the Sludge Slicer deals more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Sludge Slicer.

Corrosion
-----------

The Sludge Slicer is found in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output.

A corroded Sludge Slicer can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Sludge Slicer** | Corroded and uncoated **Sludge Slicer** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Sludge Slicer can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Sludge Slicer** (75 points per piece) | **Sludge Slicer** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Sludge Slicer can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Sludge Slicer that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Sludge Slicer** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Sludge Slicer** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Sludge Slicer can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Sludge Slicer** | **Sludge Slicer** + Any Middle Gem |  |
