**Mud Golems** are utility mobs that are currently unimplemented. They will be made by the player with Mud blocks. They will not attack players, but attack hostile mobs by throwing mud at them. They will be able to be applied with amulets, giving them a Middle Gem Circle modifier that directly affects the player they are assigned to when they are alive.
