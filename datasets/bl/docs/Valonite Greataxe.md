Crafting

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Valonite Greataxe** | Valonite Shard (2) + Valonite Axe + Weedwood Stick (2) |  |

Usage
-------

The **Valonite Greataxe** slowly sweeps across an arc, breaking any wooden blocks in the player's path. It has a sweep attack nearly identical to that of a sword, dealing 1 damage to entities hit by it.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, the **Valonite Greataxe** can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Valonite Greataxe** | Damaged **Valonite Greataxe** + Sulfur (25-49) + Life Crystal (42-83% charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The **Valonite Greataxe** made in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase the rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases the damage output and mining effectiveness.

A corroded **Valonite Greataxe** can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Removes Corrosion from the **Valonite Greataxe** | Corroded and uncoated **Valonite Greataxe** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A tool can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Valonite Greataxe** (75 points per piece) | **Valonite Greataxe** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded tool can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a tool that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Removes Corrosion from **Valonite Greataxe** (85 points per item) | Corroded **Valonite Greataxe** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, a **Valonite Greataxe** can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the axe, and in the tooltip of all tools. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
