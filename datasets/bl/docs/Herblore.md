# Herblore

**Herblore** is the process of combining and refining various Plant Items to create Infusions, the Betweenlands equivalent of potions.

Unlike vanilla Brewing, Herblore requires many extra steps and resources to produce a successful Infusion. The following is a step by step guide.

The Herblore Book details a list of Aspects and Ground Items, along with other info.

### What You'll Need
The following are some items that you'll need before getting started:

* Herblore Book: Crafted with Amate Paper and Lurker Skin. The Herblore Book is an in-game list of Aspects, Ground Items, and Infusions, along with their properties. It starts out empty, but will note which Ground Items have which Aspects when Gecko Testing while in your inventory.
* Sickle: Crafted with a Weedwood Stick, a Reed Rope, and Valonite Shards. Used to harvest Plant Items from the various plants found in the Betweenlands.
* Net: Crafted with Weedwood Sticks and Reed Rope. Used to capture Geckos for Gecko testing.

There are also a couple of utility blocks needed in this 'first' stage of Herblore.

* Mortar: Crafted with Cragrock and Weedwood Sticks. The Mortar, when equipped with a Pestle (crafted with the same materials), will be used to create the ground items.
* Gecko Cage: Crafted with Syrmorite Ingots, Reed Rope, and Weedwood Plank Slabs. The Gecko Cage will house the captured Gecko that is used in Gecko testing.

There is a plethora of different plants you can find on your journey.

### Gathering Plant Items
To start out, explore the Betweenlands and gather various plants. Different types of plants will spawn in different biomes. When broken with the Sickle, plants will drop their corresponding Plant Item, the part of the plant used in Herblore. Although it may also be wise to collect the entire plant as well (Syrmorite Shears), to farm more of them later on.

Players should also take a Net and look for Geckos, which spawn in Swamplands and Coarse Islands biomes.

### Gecko Testing
Once Plant Items have been collected, use the Mortar to grind them into Ground Items. Right-click the Gecko Cage with the captured Gecko to put it inside. From there, you can begin Gecko testing.

A Gecko, fed an item containing the Firnalaz aspect, turning it a fiery red color.

Each Ground Item has a different set of Aspects, with varying amounts and potency. Which Aspects and how much are mostly random based on world seed, and must be discovered by testing each item on a caged Gecko. To do this, simply right click the Ground Item on the caged Gecko while the Herblore book is in your inventory to note down one of the item's Aspects.

As many items have more than one Aspect, they may need to be tested multiple times. Learned aspects can be viewed by holding "shift" over the Ground Item in the inventory.

The Gecko will need time to recover between tests, and will take 1 damage () for each test, meaning it will die after 6 tests if not healed. Geckos can be healed by feeding them Sap Spit.

### Creating Infusions
After discovering some Aspects, you can start distilling aspects and brewing infusions. To do this, you will need a few more items:

* Dentrothyst Vials: Crafted with Green Dentrothyst/Orange Dentrothyst and a Rubber Ball. They serve as the containers for Infusions and Aspect Vials.

* Infuser: Crafted with Octine Ingots, Weedwood Sticks, and a Pestle. The Infuser is used along with ground items, aspect vials, and/or aspectrus fruit to make the raw Infusion Buckets to be distilled into Infusions or Aspect Vials.
* Alembic: Crafted with Octine Ingots, Cragrock, a Green Dentrothyst, and a Green Dentrothyst Vial. Used to distill Infusion Buckets into Infusions and Aspect Vials.

Much attention and care must be given during the process of infusing.

First, the Infuser must be placed over a fire and filled with water (up to 3 buckets worth). Fire can be created by holding right-click with an Octine Ingot on placed or dropped Moss, Cave Moss, or Thorns. Fire on Peat will never go out.

From there, up to 6 of any combination of Ground Items, Aspect Vials, and/or Aspectrus Fruit can be added. Specific Infusions require specific combinations of Aspects. Make sure to stir regularly; or the brew will evaporate and spawn a dangerous Shallowbreath. Stirring can also be automated with a Life Crystal.

If the Aspect combination is invalid for an infusion, it will quickly change colour and can be collected. If it is a valid infusion however, the water's colour will gradually darken as it brews, suddenly changing to the finished Infusion's colour to indicate when it's ready (~1-2 minutes), and burning if left too long.

The finished Infusion Bucket(s) can then be collected (shift-right-click with an empty bucket), containing all Aspects of the combined ingredients. You will often need to distill the bucket into separate Aspect Vials first using the Alembic, since it is likely the Aspects in the bucket are invalid for an Infusion and must be separated in order to be able make valid combinations.

Afterwards, a valid Infusion Bucket can then be put into the Alembic, turned into a proper Infusion, and be collected in Dentrothyst Vials. The Infusion obtained will depend on the combination of aspects in the Infusion Bucket used to create it. Invalid/unfinished Infusion Buckets will instead yield a varying amount of Aspect Vials, which can be used again in the Infuser to combine the correct aspects together for an infusion.

Effects of Aspects on Infusions
---------------------------------

Besides determining the type of Infusion, Aspects also affect Potency and Duration. Aspects in Infusion Buckets and Aspect Vials have a specified amount, shown in their tooltip, which determine the traits of the results:

* Each Infusion recipe has one Aspect that determines Potency, and one that determines Duration. The more of that Aspect, the greater the Duration/Potency respectively, adding 1 level per full (5.0) Aspect Vial. However, as only 6 items can be added, players must choose between levels of Potency and Duration. Infusions have a minimum Potency of 1 (I) and a maximum of 5 (V). Their minimum and maximum Durations depend on the type of Infusion.
* The total amount of all Aspect in the Infusion Bucket determines the amount of Infusions that can be distilled from it.
* Any Aspects that do not affect Duration or Potency can be added in the bare minimum amount (0.11), as greater amounts of them will not affect the resulting Infusion, only the amount of Infusions obtained from it.

Aspectrus Plants.

Farming Aspects
-----------------

Optionally, should you continue to use Herblore, you may find it helpful to farm your Aspects. Plants can be farmed with basic plant farming, but Aspects can also be grown directly with Aspectrus Plants after obtaining Aspect Vials from brewing.

This can be done by placing an Aspect Vial in a Censer, imbuing any nearby Aspectrus Plants with that Aspect. When the plant is finished growing, it will drop Aspectrus Fruit imbued with the corresponding Aspect. The fruit can be used as another brewing ingredient that is much easier to obtain, although each fruit will only contain 0.25 of an Aspect.

Storing Aspects
-----------------

Dentrothyst Vials or Aspect Vials can be placed directly on the ground for easy storage. Placed vials can be filled or emptied by right-clicking or shift-right-clicking them with an empty Vial or Aspect Vial of the same type, depositing or removing 0.10 Aspect per click. Each Vial can hold up to 5.0 of an Aspect.

Infusion Recipes
------------------

See the Infusing page for a list of recipes. Additionally, see the Infusions page for more information on their effects.
