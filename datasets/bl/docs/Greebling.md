Description
-------------

A shy creature, the Greebling can only be found by following the lilting sound of their music. The gremlin's music is best enjoyed from a distance, however, as disturbing the Greebling will make him disappear.

Upon entering the range of a Greebling, ambient music will be stopped in favor of the Greebling's own music. Greeblings can spawn in two variants; one with brown clothes and a panflute, and the other with red clothes and a stringed instrument. Both variants have their own sound, and will play in tandem with each other. Music from Greeblings of the same variant will not overlap.

Trivia
--------

* The music played by the Greeblings is to the tune of the Explorer's Disc, one of the many music discs found in The Betweenlands.
* The string instrument of the red-clothed Greebling variant is based off of a combination of the lute and the morin khuur.
