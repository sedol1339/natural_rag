Appearance & Music
--------------------

Presents can appear in a multitude of different colours, based on the vanilla dyes. The default colour is white, but they can also appear in red, orange, yellow, lime, green, cyan, light blue, blue, purple, magenta, pink, light gray, gray, black, and brown colours.

Presents will also play a Christmas-themed music track while the Winter event remains active, which can help nearby players to find them.

Collecting Loot
-----------------

Each Present spawns with a random item (can be stacked) already inside of it. When broken, it will drop whatever item is stored inside. These items are simple goodies that are mostly exclusive to the Winter event.

Loot
------

The loot in Presents is derived from only one loot table: present\_loot.
