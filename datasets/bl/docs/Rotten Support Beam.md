Rotten Support Beams ingame

**Rotten Support Beams** are decorative blocks that can be found in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon. There are three different visual variants.

Contents

* 1 Placement

Placement
-----------

Rotten Support Beams can only be placed on the side of most blocks. Breaking the block a Rotten Support Beam is attached to will cause the beam to break as well.

The way the Rotten Support Beam curves depends on what section of the block it is placed on; it will curve downwards if placed on the bottom half, and upwards if placed on the top half.

Fuel
------

Rotten Support Beams can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per beam.
