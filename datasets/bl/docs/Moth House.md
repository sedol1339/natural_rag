Right-click the moth house with Silk Grubs to fill it with grubs. A Moth House can hold up to 6 grubs. Each grub can produce a max of 3 Silk Threads. This means a Moth House can only have 18 Silk Threads at once.

Right-click the Moth House to retrieve the Silk Threads. Shift-right click to retrieve both the Silk Grubs and Silk Threads.

Lanterns placed in a 7x7x7 area around the Moth House will boost production speed, up to a max of 3 lanterns.

The Moth House will interact with Hoppers and Syrmorite Hoppers.
