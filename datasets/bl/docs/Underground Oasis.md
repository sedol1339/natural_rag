An Underground Oasis with a Giant Bulb-Capped Mushroom

**Underground Oases** are terrain structures that generate in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers. They are small caves featuring a luscious patch of grass with various plants, a ceiling covered in stalactites, and a central monster spawner.

Despite their risks, Underground Oases can be a relief to players lost underground in search of restoring hunger or decay, and may also be prime places to set up mob farms.
