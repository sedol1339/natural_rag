Description
-------------

Worm Holes take on an appearance similar to Lampreys, and can be hard to spot at times. Once they detect a player, they will emit flame particles, similar to a mob spawner, before spawning between 2 to 3 Small Sludge Worms from its open end. Although they may seem completely immobile at first glance, they can actually move their position, and, to make matters worse, follow you thought the entire dungeon.

Strategy
----------

They can be quite tricky to spot at first, as they can blend in with the blocks they are surrounded by / inside of, however, all the blending in disappears as soon as it begins spawning Small Sludge Worms. It's honestly best to ignore the worms it spawns, as if you attack them, you can find out very quickly that the hole has escaped, or, worse, you can get overrun. a Shockwave Sword is very useful for fighting them (if they are low to the ground), though if you do not have that, it's best to just deal with it the quickest way you find possible.
