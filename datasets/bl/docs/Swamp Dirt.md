Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Swamp Dirt generates predominantly in a small layer between the surface and underground layers in Patchy Islands, Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, Marsh, and Sludge Plains biomes and the Swamplands Clearing and Sludge Plains Clearing sub-biomes. It also generates in patches in the Cavern layer (between Y-layers 95 and 45), and in Underground Oases.

### Drops
Swamp Dirt drops from breaking Swamp Grass, Dead Grass, Coarse Swamp Dirt, Sludgy Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Purified Swamp Grass, and Dug Purified Swamp Dirt.

### Death & Decay
Swamp Grass and Dead Grass will eventually become Swamp Dirt if a solid block is placed directly on top of them.

Dug Swamp Dirt that is not composted will eventually revert to regular Swamp Dirt if it is left unfilled.

Properties
------------

### Plant Support
Swamp Dirt supports the placement and growth of basic plants. In addition, it supports the spread of Swamp Grass.

### Digging
Right-clicking on the top of Swamp Dirt with a Betweenlands shovel will turn it into Dug Swamp Dirt, which is used in Farming. Note that the block will revert back to regular Swamp Dirt if it is left unfilled.
