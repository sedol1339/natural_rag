# Tunnel Entrances

A Tunnel Entrance with a Crypt Crawler nearby.

A Tunnel Entrance.

Description
-------------

**Tunnel Entrances** are small structures that temporarily spawn during the Heavy Rain and Blood Sky events, with some differences. In both events, **Tunnel Entrances** take up a 3x3 block area, and appear as Mud Brick Shingles slanting inwards to a hole texture. These holes may spawn anywhere a 3x3 flat space in the ground is available, and will begin to spawn mobs once approached by the player. Upon the end of the event, all active **Tunnel Entrances** will disappear and be replaced by whatever blocks were there before, however all mobs spawned by these entrances will remain until despawning or being slain.

Mobs
------

The mobs these holes spawn differs between event. During the Heavy Rain event, these entrances will spawn Tiny Sludge Worms, Small Sludge Worms, and Large Sludge Worms, and will continue to do so until the end of the event.

During a Blood Sky, the holes will instead spawn Crypt Crawlers when approached. Unlike the Heavy Rain version, these variants will only spawn a few Crypt Crawlers until disappearing and relocating. There is no visual difference between either variant.

History
