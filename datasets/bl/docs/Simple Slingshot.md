The **Simple Slingshot** is a craftable low damage ranged weapon. They are also used by Greebling Riders.

Although it is out-preformed by other Bows, the Simple Slingshot and its ammo are incredibly cheap to craft.

Crafting
----------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple Slingshot** | Reed Rope (2) + Weedwood Stick |  |

Shooting
----------

The Simple Slingshot behaves almost identically to any other Bow. Holding left click will draw the weapon back, and releasing it will shoot a pebble, consuming 1 point of durability. The further the slingshot is pulled back, the faster and further the released pebble travels and the more damage it deals. Its pullback time is about the same as a regular Bow's.

Unlike other Bows, the Simple Slingshot can only shoot Betweenstone Pebbles.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Simple Slingshot can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Simple Slingshot** | Damaged **Simple Slingshot** + Sulfur (3-6) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) | File:Repair Simple Slingshot.png |

Corrosion
-----------

The Simple Slingshot is made in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its maximum pullback power.

A corroded Simple Slingshot can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Simple Slingshot** | Corroded and uncoated **Simple Slingshot** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Simple Slingshot can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Simple Slingshot** (75 points per piece) | **Simple Slingshot** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Simple Slingshot can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Simple Slingshot** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Simple Slingshot** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Notes
-------

* Middle Gems cannot be applied to Simple Slingshots.
* Unlike bows, the Simple Slingshot does not work with the Draught of Sagittarius.
* If the player is afflicted by a Weakbow Draught, their Slingshot's maximum range will be severely reduced.
* If the player drinks a Swiftarm Brew, their Slingshot's pullback time will be drastically reduced.
