Coloration

Swamp Tallgrass takes on different foliage colors depending on what biome it is in. The grass color is:

* #6BC44E in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #627017 in Marsh biomes

* #2AFF00 to  #50A040 in Swamplands biomes

Collection
------------

Swamp Tallgrass must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Swamp Tallgrass Blades, which can then be ground into Ground Swamp Tallgrass.

Growing
---------

Swamp Tallgrass will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Swamp Tallgrass can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. It can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Swamp Tallgrass has a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Swamp Tallgrass will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
