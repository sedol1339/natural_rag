Consuming
-----------

When eaten, Kraken Tentacles restore 8 hunger.

Food Sickness
---------------

Like most other foods, Kraken Tentacles have a food sickness level (0-180) that increases by 5 each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. They start out in a "Tastes good" state, but will diminish to "Tastes plain" when they reach 50 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" when reaching 110 points. Foods at 110 points or above will restore little to nothing when eaten.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of food that is below 110 sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is below 10 points) on every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings, which reset all other food sickness levels to 0 but in turn become sickening to eat themselves until another food reaches 110 points again. Visit the Food Sickness page for more details.
