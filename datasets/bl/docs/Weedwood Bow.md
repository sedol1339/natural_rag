Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Weedwood Bow** | Weedwood Stick (3) + Reed Rope (3) |  |

Shooting
----------

Like a regular Bow, the Weedwood Bow can be held to be drawn back and released to shoot the currently prioritized arrow, using some durability. The further the bow is pulled back, the faster and further the released arrow travels and the more damage it deals. Its pullback time is about the same as a regular Bow's.

The Weedwood Bow can shoot a variety of different types of arrows: Angler Tooth Arrows, Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrows, Octine Arrows, Shock Arrows, Basilisk Arrows, Chiromaw Barbs, and Sludge Worm Arrows.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Weedwood Bow can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Weedwood Bow** | Damaged **Weedwood Bow** + Sulfur (3-6) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Weedwood Bow is made in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its maximum pullback power.

A corroded Weedwood Bow can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Weedwood Bow** | Corroded and uncoated **Weedwood Bow** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Weedwood Bow can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Weedwood Bow** (75 points per piece) | **Weedwood Bow** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Weedwood Bow can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Weedwood Bow that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Weedwood Bow** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Weedwood Bow** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Weedwood Bow can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Weedwood Bow** | **Weedwood Bow** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Notes
-------

* If the player drinks a Draught of Sagittarius, they will be able to see the path the arrow will travel from their Weedwood Bow. On the other hand, if they are afflicted by a Weakbow Draught, their Weedwood Bow's maximum range will be severely reduced.
* If the player drinks a Swiftarm Brew, their Weedwood Bow's pullback time will be drastically reduced.
