Changelog
---------

### Additions and Changes

* Tamed Emberlings can now be equipped with Amulets and Amulet Slots
* Sludge Menace and Dreadful Peat Mummy now heal when no player is nearby
* Dreadful Peat Mummy can now swim much better and faster
* The Ring of Recruitment now shows some icons above recruited mobs' heads (staying still, fighting/following player, guarding). It also offers a new command for recruited mobs: guarding. A recruited mob that is set to guard will stay within the current area and not follow the player, but instead attack any hostile mob that gets in range.
* Feeding Tamed Small Spirit Tree Faces Compost now makes them heal and drop Sap Spit
* The Ring of Gathering was changed slightly and now allows you to recall pets or minions that are not sitting on demand, with a keybind (see controls)
* Torches can now be placed on Amate Paper Panes
* Herblore Book now shows in color when all aspects of an ingredient have been found. Underlined text can now be clicked and takes you to the page with further detail about the ingredient.

### Bug Fixes

* Tamed Emberlings are no longer considered hostile and affected by Repeller, Ring of Summoning, etc.
* Fixed a crash with certain audio mods. This is just a workaround to prevent the crash and instead just cause the Greebling music to not sync properly.
* Fixed Sludge Menace and Dreadful Peat Mummy despawning
* Fixed Sludge Menace not classified as boss
* Fixed Sludgeon boss room not fully protected and allowing the player to place blocks
* Fixed falling blocks in Sludgeon not saving properly
* Fixed Dungeon Doors dropping items
* Fixed Yihinren aspect missing from the Lightweight Draught elixir recipe
* Fixed some Gecko Cage messages now shown properly when shield equipped in off-hand
* Fixed Sludge Worms moving and attacking while dying
