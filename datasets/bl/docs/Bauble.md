Obtaining

### Post-Generation
Baubles generate randomly over time under most leaves, including Weedwood, Rubber Tree, Sap Tree, Hearthgrove, and Nibbletwig Leaves as part of trees, during the Winter seasonal event. When the event is not active, they will disappear over time.

Properties
------------

### Placement
Baubles can only be placed on the underside of blocks.

### Coloration
Baubles can appear in a multitude of different colors, based on the vanilla dyes. The default color is red, but they can also appear in yellow, green, cyan, light blue, blue, purple, and pink.

Drops
-------

When broken, Baubles drop 1 XP. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in Survival Mode, and do not appear in the Creative Mode inventory.
