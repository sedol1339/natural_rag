Description
-------------

### Spawning
Infestations can spawn anywhere in the Cavern or Lake Cavern layers.

They will also spawn when an Infested Weedwood Bush passes the final stage of infestation.

### Behavior
Infestations appear as a small, ground-based swarm of beetles that slowly approach the player. They do not need line of sight to target a player, and will climb on walls and ceilings to approach them, emitting a loud crawling sound as they move. When the player gets too close, they will become infested with bugs.

The infestation swarm itself will also shrink the longer it is submerged in a liquid. Infestations are also very weak to fire.

When the swarm is hit by a high damage attack, it has a chance of splitting into 4 smaller swarms, each with the same amount of health the swarm had left after the attack. Smaller swarms have less range and apply their effect slower. These swarms can recombine, though they do not regain health when doing this. These split swarms can spread out far from the original infestation, so it is advised to stand back when attacking.

#### Infestation
When the player gets too close, the screen will begin to fill with bugs and 2 damage () will be dealt every few seconds, speeding up the more bugs there are on screen. The on-screen bugs act similarly to Poison, meaning the player will not die from the swarming effect itself, but can still die from contact with the infestation swarm.

The player can slowly get rid of the on-screen bugs by jumping, sneaking, swinging, or shaking their head. They can also get rid of them faster by completely submerging themselves in a liquid or setting themselves on fire.

Pheromone Extract
-------------------

Pheromone Extract can be consumed to make Infestations ignore the player. Getting too close will still cause the player to become infested.

Drops
-------

Swarms split off from the main swarm will also have their own drops.

No Bug Resource Pack

* A "No Creeps" resource pack is available here that removes the Infestation's particles and overlay, to stop the bugs from crawling on your screen.
