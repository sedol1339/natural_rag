Coloration
------------

Rubber Tree Leaves take on different foliage colors depending on what biome they are in. The foliage color is:

* #48B518 if in the inventory
* #A8A800 to  #A87800 in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #63B581 in Marsh biomes
* #00AD7C in Patchy Islands biomes
* #D36423 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #52AF5A to  #85AF51 in Swamplands biomes
* #52AF5A in Swamplands Clearing biomes

Particles
-----------

Small leaf particles will fall around Rubber Tree Leaves.

Decay
-------

Like other leaves, natural Rubber Tree Leaves spontaneously decay and disappear when they receive a block tick if they are not connected to any living wood block.

Rubber Tree Leaves placed by the player will never naturally decay.

Collection
------------

When decayed or harvested normally, Rubber Tree Leaves usually drop nothing, but have a chance to drop a Rubber Tree Sapling. The leaf blocks themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Compostability
----------------

Rubber Tree Leaves have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 4. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Rubber Tree Leaves will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
