Spawning
----------

Fireflies can spawn in all biomes on the surface of The Betweenlands, *except* for Swamplands Clearing biomes. However, they will only spawn when the sky light in the dimension is low enough - specifically, when the Rift event is *not* active, *or* only during the night when it *is* active.

Fireflies spawn more commonly during the Blood Sky event, and in this case can spawn regardless of the amount of sky light.

Behavior
----------

Fireflies slowly fly around aimlessly. They can serve as light sources, since they give off orange-tinted dynamic lighting. They periodically turn this light off and on as they fly slowly around.

During the Heavy Rain event, Fireflies will seek shelter from the rain under blocks.

Fireflies can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

### Catching
If they manage to be caught, Fireflies can be right-clicked with a Net to capture them as an inventory item. This item can then be right-clicked on the ground to release the Firefly as an entity there.

Usage
-------

### Feeding
Caught Firefly items have a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, they can be right-clicked onto the juvenile to feed it.
