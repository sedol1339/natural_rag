Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Mire Snail Egg items can drop from looting Greebling Corpses.

### Breeding
A Mire Snail Egg is produced upon breeding two Mire Snails together by feeding both of them with Sludge Balls or Sap Spit.

Behavior
----------

### Growth
A Mire Snail Egg will hatch into another fully grown Mire Snail after about 10 minutes. However, it can be killed before being allowed to develop.

### Collection
A Mire Snail Egg can be right-clicked to collect it as a **Mire Snail Egg** item, which can be right-clicked on the ground to release it as an entity again.

Drops
-------

The drops from Mire Snail Eggs are derived from the mire\_snail\_egg loot table. However, this contains no content by default.

Visit the Loot Tables page for more information on loot.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Mire Snail Egg items restore 2 hunger and 0.4 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Mire Snail Egg items have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Mire Snail Egg items have a 25% chance to restore only 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Mire Snail Egg items have a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If they are desired, they can be right-clicked onto the juvenile to feed it.
