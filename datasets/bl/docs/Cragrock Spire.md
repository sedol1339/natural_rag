A particularly tall Cragrock Spire

**Cragrock Spires** are thick, spire-like terrain structures that generate in Deep Waters biomes, jutting out of the water. They are covered by moss at the top and are often covered in patches of lichen, surrounded by algae at the waterline, and housing barnacles below the water's surface. They can cluster together almost like mountains.
