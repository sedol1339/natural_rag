Weedwood Logs ingame

**Weedwood Logs** are the outside layer log blocks of Weedwood Trees and Giant Weedwood Trees, as well as their roots and branches. They can also be found as part of Marsh Ruins. They have a normal rotatable variant and a variant with bark on all sides, both of which can be ground into Ground Weedwood Bark. They are considered alternative Plant Items.
