### Consuming
When eaten, Gert's Donut restores 8 health, 6 hunger, and 3.6 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Gert's Donut has a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time it is eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Gert's Donut only restores 2 hunger () when eaten, a third of the original hunger value.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Trivia
--------

* The name of the item is a reference to a friend of the development team, Gert, who created various textures for the mod.
* As an easter egg, Gert's Donut can be put into the Weedwood Jukebox as if it were a music disc. Rather than playing any sort of track, the jukebox will consume all of the donuts in the stack, play an eating sound, and simply say "DOH!" above the hotbar. The donuts can be retrieved from the jukebox again.
