*"Once the surge of dark energy had subsided, the once-great Sorcerer opened their eyes. But they did not breathe, for they were no longer truly living. They too had become a Wight, their mind, body and soul corrupted. Their head hung low, with a sad, mournful expression playing across their face. But they did not feel grief... they did not feel anything at all any more. Only burning malice within. The Sorcerer had become the Prime Wight, with an army of Wights to serve and do their bidding. They had got just what they had wanted; they now wielded unimaginable power."*

> *-From The Story of The Betweenlands*

The **Prime Wight** is the currently unimplemented final boss of the Betweenlands mod, and is the ruler of the dimension. Defeating him will be the final step in freeing the Betweenlands of its corrupted state.

In life he was a powerful sorcerer who theorized that the power of the nether could be used as a tool for peace. He is responsible for the current state of the Betweenlands.
