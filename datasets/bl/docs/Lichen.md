Lichen ingame

Smelting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dead Lichen + 0.1 XP | **Lichen** + Any fuel |  |

Growth and Decay
------------------

Regular Lichen naturally goes through cycles of growth, spreading to nearby blocks slowly over time and eventually dying out.

Dead Lichen does not grow.

Collection
------------

Lichen must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops a Lichen Clump, which can then be ground into Ground Lichen.

Compostability
----------------

Regular Lichen has a compost process time of 7 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Dead Lichen has a compost process time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Igniting
----------

Lichen can be used to create fire by holding right-click on either its placed or dropped form with an Octine Ingot. Lichen that is adjacent to or on a Block of Octine will also catch fire, although this fire will not spread to further Lichen blocks.

Grinding Uses
