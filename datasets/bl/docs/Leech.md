Description
-------------

Leeches appear as brownish, silverfish-like worms. They exist in two states: "hungry" and "full." When they are hungry they will rush toward the nearest mob or player and latch on, dealing melee damage over time. They will remain affixed until they have had their fill at which point they will let go and become "full." Leeches will not attack when full, but become hungry again after a period of time.

Leeches can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

Strategy
----------

In the early and even middle-tier game, Leeches can be surprisingly powerful. They leech large amounts of damage, and if you have no armor even two Leeches clinging on to you one after the other is enough to kill. They should merely be avoided until you have weaponry to kill them before they have a chance to completely leech you of health, and as shields do not work on them, another difficulty is brought up. The best counter to all this is to get one to connect to a Swamp Hag (which is surprisingly easy) and kill it while it is still full.

Drops
-------

The drops from Leeches are derived from the leech loot table.
