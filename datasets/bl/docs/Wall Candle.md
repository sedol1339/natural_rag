Wall Candles ingame

Placement
-----------

Wall Candles can only be placed on the side of most blocks. Breaking the block a Wall Candle is attached to will cause the candle to break as well.

Candle

Wall Candles can be right-clicked to toggle their light on and off.

Providing Light
-----------------

When lit, Wall Candles provide a light level of 13, which is slightly less light than both vanilla Torches and Sulfur Torches. They will not burn out in The Betweenlands, nor do they become extinguished when exposed to rain from the Heavy Rain event.
