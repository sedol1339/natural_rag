### Crafting Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coarse Swamp Dirt** (2) | Swamp Dirt + Silt |  |

### Generation
Coarse Swamp Dirt generates in a small layer between the surface and underground layers in Swamplands biomes, and occasionally breaks its surface in patches.

Properties
------------

### Plant Support
Coarse Swamp Dirt supports the placement and growth of basic plants. Unlike regular Swamp Dirt, however, it does not support the spread of Swamp Grass.

### Digging
Right-clicking on the top of Coarse Swamp Dirt with a Betweenlands shovel will turn it into Dug Swamp Dirt, which is used in Farming. Note that the block will revert back to regular Swamp Dirt if it is left unfilled.

Drops
-------

When broken, Coarse Swamp Dirt drops regular Swamp Dirt. The block itself must be broken with a Silky Pebble explosion or a Silk Touch tool to be collected.
