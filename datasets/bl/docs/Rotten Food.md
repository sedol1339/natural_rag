Obtaining
-----------

### The Betweenlands
While in The Betweenlands, most food from other dimensions in the player's inventory will instantly turn into Rotten Food. The original food's identity will be retained and displayed in parentheses as part of the item name, and the size of the food stack will remain intact.

While the food rotting mechanic is on by default, the mod's config.cfg file can be used to disable or reenable it. The config can also be used to blacklist additional items to turn into Rotten Food, or whitelist specific items to *not* turn into Rotten Food.

Items do not become Rotten Food while in Creative Mode.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Rotten Food *depletes* 1 hunger and restores 1 saturation. It also inflicts the  Poison II and  Hunger II effects for 10 seconds each. It can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is full.

Unlike most other foods, Rotten Food is not affected by Food Sickness.

### Reverting
If Rotten Food is returned to a dimension other than The Betweenlands, it will revert back to its original food item, retaining its stack size.

This functionality is on by default, and can be disabled or reenabled in the mod's config.cfg file.
