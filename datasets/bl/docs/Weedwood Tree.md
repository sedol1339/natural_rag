**Weedwood Trees** are the most common type of tree in The Betweenlands. They generate in Swamplands, Patchy Islands, Coarse Islands, and Marsh biomes, and can be grown with Weedwood Saplings.

They are generally around 20 blocks tall and around 19 blocks wide, featuring a thick, sloped trunk with supporting roots and branches, and a wide, bushy canopy. They can be found on land or partially submerged underwater.

Weedwood Trees are important as the main source of the wood materials needed to craft many of the blocks and items in the Betweenlands.

Composition
-------------

Weedwood Trees consist of:

* Weedwood Log, as the outer bark, root and branch block
* Weedwood, as the inner trunk block
* Weedwood Leaves, as the leaf block
* Poison Ivy, occasionally hanging from the branches

History
---------

* Alpha 3.2.0: Reduced Poison Ivy generation on the trees.
* Beta 2.0.0: No longer uses Weedwood Bark; now uses Weedwood Logs with bark texture on all sides for every outside part of the tree.
* **Beta 1.0.0**: Introduced.
