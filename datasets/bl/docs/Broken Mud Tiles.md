Broken Mud Tiles ingame

**Broken Mud Tiles** are special hazard blocks that are found in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon.

Hazard
--------

Broken Mud Tiles will break when a player walks over them, leaving behind Stagnant Water in the process. This can be prevented by sneaking while walking over the block.

Collection
------------

Broken Mud Tiles will drop nothing, but leave behind Stagnant Water when broken. Unlike most blocks, they do not have block protection in the Sludgeon. They must be harvested with a Silk Touch tool to be collected.
