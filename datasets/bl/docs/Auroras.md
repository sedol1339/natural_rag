Several pink auroras

**Auroras** are a weather event that can occur occasionally in The Betweenlands. They primarily consist of visual changes in the sky of the dimension.

This event can only *start* naturally during the Rift event *or* the Winter seasonal event. Note that it can remain active after either event has ended.

Effects
---------

During the Auroras event, streaks of neon light called auroras will appear very high in the sky of the dimension. These streaks can spawn in varying colors (only one at a time), sizes, and curving formations, and will drift slowly across the sky in random directions. New auroras may appear and old ones may disappear throughout the duration of the event.

While the Auroras event is primarily aesthetic, there are a couple of minor gameplay changes:

* Wisps will *not* disappear even when a player gets close to them during the event, regardless of their location within the dimension. This allows them to be broken, collected in the inventory, and placed elsewhere.
* A certain Simulacrum effect will only activate while this event is active.

### Prediction
The Wind Chime forecast visual for the Auroras event

The Auroras event can be predicted up to 5 minutes before it starts by a Wind Chime, or up to 10 minutes before if it is attuned to the event.

When forecasting, a forecast visual will emanate from the Wind Chime, and a unique chime jingle sound will play:
