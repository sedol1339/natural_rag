A couple of Sap Trees in a Swamplands biome

**Sap Trees** are a type of tree that generates uncommonly in Swamplands, Patchy Islands, and Coarse Islands biomes. They are around 17 blocks tall and 13 blocks wide. They feature a trunk with many branches supporting small clusters of leaves, and a small base of roots.

Sap Trees are extremely useful because their logs are a source of Balls of Sap, one of the few items capable of restoring Decay.
