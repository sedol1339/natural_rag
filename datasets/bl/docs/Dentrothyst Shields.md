Blocking
----------

Like any shield, Dentrothyst Shields can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player receives a small amount of knockback upon blocking. The shields can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

Dentrothyst Shields have the unique ability to prevent the player from receiving effects from splash potions while blocking, including those from thrown Infusions. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, splash effects will not be blocked either.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Dentrothyst Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Dentrothyst Shield** | Any damaged **Dentrothyst Shield** + Sulfur (6-10) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, a Dentrothyst Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
