Description
-------------

Silt Crabs appear as small blue crabs with thick shells and orange claws and legs. They move quickly by walking from side to side. They will attack the player by giving them a quick nip before scurrying quickly away into the water. They cannot swim, and instead will simply sink. They do not drown however. When in the water, they will start attacking the player outright.

Strategy
----------

Silt Crabs are arguably one of the most annoying, if not necessarily dangerous, mobs to deal with. They are almost always found in great numbers and easily dodge sword strikes using their fast speed and small size, and after striking once they wait for you to get distracted by something else again to strike once more. Try singling out the crabs and chasing them somewhere where they will be slowed down or they will find it harder to get away from you.

Drops
-------

The drops from Silt Crabs are derived from the silt\_crab loot table.
