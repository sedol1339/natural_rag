Functions
-----------

The Sword of Legends functions similarly to a regular sword. Like all Betweenlands tools, the Sword of Legends deals more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools. It will also stay in the player's inventory even if they die.

Corrosion
-----------

The Sword of Legends is obtained in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output.

A corroded Sword of Legends can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0. A tool can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted. Visit the Corrosion page for more details.

Middle Gems
-------------

The Sword of Legends cannot be applied with Middle Gems. However, in the future, it will have all three gem modifiers automatically built into it, and will be able to "switch" between which one to use. This will allow it to adapt to any part of the Middle Gem Circle in order to maximize power.

History
---------

* Beta 2.0.0: Temporarily removed.
* **Beta 1.0.0**: Introduced, but unobtainable.
