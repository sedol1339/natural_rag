Roots ingame

**Roots** are unique twisting wood blocks that generate in the water in Coarse Islands biomes and on land in Sludge Plains biomes. They can also be found on both natural and Root Pod-grown Giant Roots, around natural Spirit Trees, in Cragrock Towers, and in the Wight Fortress.

Placement
-----------

Placed Roots connect vertically with each other, forming elongated Root "strands" that grow smaller the further they are to the tip.

Collection
------------

When harvested normally, Roots drop a Tangled Root, which can then be consumed or ground into Ground Roots.

Roots themselves cannot be collected.

Fuel
------

Roots can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per root block.

Compostability
----------------

Roots have a compost process time of 10 minutes and a compost amount of 20. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Roots will take on an alternative texture during the Spook seasonal event.
