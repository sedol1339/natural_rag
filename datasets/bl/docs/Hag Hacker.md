Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hag Hacker** (20 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (12% charge) |  |

Attacking
-----------

Against most mobs, the Hag Hacker only deals its minimum base damage; however, it will instantly kill any Swamp Hags it is used against, making it very useful. Like all Betweenlands tools, the Hag Hacker deals more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools.

The Hag Hacker is unique in that it has certain elements of both a sword and an axe. It has the same attack speed as an axe and is capable of disabling shields. However, it can also deal damage to multiple mobs in swipes, like a sword, and does not cut down wood more efficiently than a sword does.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Hag Hacker.

Corrosion
-----------

The Hag Hacker is found in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output.

A corroded Hag Hacker can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Hag Hacker** | Corroded and uncoated **Hag Hacker** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Hag Hacker can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Hag Hacker** (75 points per piece) | **Hag Hacker** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Hag Hacker can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Hag Hacker that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Hag Hacker** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Hag Hacker** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Hag Hacker can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Hag Hacker** | **Hag Hacker** + Any Middle Gem |  |
