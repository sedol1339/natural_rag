Obtaining
-----------

### Animating Recipe
The Swift Pick has a chance to be found as treasure from animating Item Scrolls or Fabricated Scrolls.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Swift Pick** (12 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal fuel (16 charge) |  |
| **Swift Pick** (12 weight \* 3/5) | Fabricated Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal fuel (16 charge) |  |

### Loot
The Swift Pick can be found as Loot from chests in Cragrock Towers, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Mining
The Swift Pick mines stone-based blocks at an extremely rapid pace, breaking most blocks almost instantly.

### Repairing
Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Swift Pick.

### Corrosion
The Swift Pick is found in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output and mining effectiveness.

A corroded Swift Pick can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Swift Pick** | Corroded and uncoated **Swift Pick** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Swift Pick can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Swift Pick** (75 points per piece) | **Swift Pick** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Swift Pick can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Swift Pick that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Swift Pick** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Swift Pick** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

### Middle Gems
As with most equipment, the Swift Pick can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Swift Pick** | **Swift Pick** + Any Middle Gem |  |
