Obtaining
-----------

### Aspect Combinations & Distilling
Infusions are created by placing Infusion Buckets with valid Aspect combinations into the Alembic. For more information on the entire brewing process, see Herblore. For the Aspect combinations required to make each Infusion, see the List of Infusions.

Properties
------------

### Effects
Infusions can have varying effects, from ones similar to vanilla potions, to entirely new and unique ones. Infusion recipes do not depend on the types of ingredients, but rather the types of Aspects randomly generated within them.

The potency and duration of the Infusion are determined by the amount of two specific aspects respectively within the Infusion Bucket used to make them. Essentially, this means that the greater amount of whichever aspect affects potency, the stronger the infusion's effect is (if applicable), and the greater amount of whichever aspect affects duration, the longer the infusion lasts. Which aspects act as potency and duration modifiers depends on the infusion recipe, and are mentioned in the Herblore Book.

Infusions have a minimum potency and duration level of 1 (I) and a maximum level of 5 (V), and their minimum and maximum values depend on the type of infusion. Every 6.0 amount of the potency or duration aspect used (non-inclusive) equates to 1 level, meaning that using between 0.01 and 5.99 of the aspect will result in level 1, between 6.0 and 11.99 will result in level 2, and so on. However, the actual duration value is based on the exact duration aspect amount and can vary within the same level. Also, since only a maximum of 6 ingredients can be infused at a time, both potency and duration cannot be maximized on the same infusion.

The total amount of *all* aspects in the initial Infusion Bucket determines the number of resulting Infusions that can be obtained from it. Every 4.5 total aspect amount used (inclusive) equates to 1 infusion, meaning that having a total amount between 0.01 and 4.5 will produce 1 infusion, between 4.51 and 9.0 will produce 2 infusions, and so on.

The Infusion's effects, potency level, and duration can all be viewed in its tooltip on the item.

### Consuming Infusions
When infusions from Green Dentrothyst Vials are consumed normally (not thrown), they leave behind Dirty Dentrothyst Vials. These vials must be cleaned in the Purifier before they can be reused, like so:

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green Dentrothyst Vial | Dirty Dentrothyst Vial + Sulfur + Swamp Water (1 bucket) |  |

Infusions from Orange Dentrothyst Vials simply leave behind empty vials when consumed normally; these can be immediately reused without having to be cleaned.

### Throwing Infusions
Any Infusion can be thrown like a vanilla Splash Potion by simply pressing shift and holding right-click to aim. The longer you hold the Infusion to throw, the farther it will travel. It will apply the effect to all entities in a splash radius around where it lands. This allows you to apply positive Infusion effects to multiple allies, or use negative Infusions on enemies.

Every time a thrown Infusion shatters, it will leave behind 2-3 Dentrothyst Shards of its corresponding vial type, and also has a 50% chance to leave behind a Rubber Ball.

List of Infusions
-------------------

The following is a list of Infusions categorized by tier, the combination of Aspects needed to make them, and their effect. The combinations are based off of the randomly generated Aspects found in the ingredients used, not the ingredients themselves. Tiers determine how many aspects are used in the creation, as well as the tier of their types.

Aspects colored in red text act as "strength" modifiers, meaning the more of that aspect is in the combination, the more potent its effect is. Aspects colored in blue text act as "duration" modifiers, meaning the more of that aspect is in the combination, the longer lasting its effect is.
