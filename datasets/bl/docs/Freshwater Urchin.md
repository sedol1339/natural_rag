Behavior
----------

Freshwater Urchins will avoid the player and other hostile mobs, shooting a wave of spikes if they get too close. This leaves them defenseless for a few moments as they regenerate their spikes. While they have spikes, attacking them will hurt the offender. On land, they are incapable of shooting spikes or moving, but will not suffocate.

### Catching
Freshwater Urchins can be caught with a Net. They will still shoot spikes when released.
