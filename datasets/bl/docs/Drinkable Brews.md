**Drinkable Brews** are drinkable items that have varying effects. They can act as food items, saturation toppers, and/or weak alternatives to vanilla Potions or infusions.

There are 11 varieties of Drinkable Brew, all of which are made with combinations of various items, including certain Plant Items and Ground Items, in a steeping pot.

Obtaining
-----------

### Collection
Any Drinkable Brew item can be collected by right-clicking a Steeping Pot containing the corresponding Drinkable Brew fluid with a Weedwood Bowl. Each bowl collects 250 mB worth of fluid, meaning that every steeping process yields up to 4 Drinkable Brew items.

See the Steeping page for more information on how to make Drinkable Brew fluids.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When drunk, each Drinkable Brew causes one or more varying effects, depending on the type. Most brews restore at least some saturation, but may do other things such as restoring hunger, granting useful status effects, or providing a temporary background effect that does not show up as a status effect and cannot be removed by effect-clearing items such as Tangled Roots. In every case, drinking one will return the empty Weedwood Bowl.

List of Drinkable Brews
-------------------------

The following is a list of all Drinkable Brews, their Steeping ingredients, and their effect/s upon drinking.

| Drinkable Brews | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Drinkable Brew** | **Steeping Ingredients** | **Effects** |
| **Nettle Soup** | Clean Water (1000 mB) +  Black Hat Mushroom (item) +  Flathead Mushroom (item) +  Nettle or  Flowered Nettle | Restores 2 hunger and 0.6 saturation. Can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is already full. Is not affected by Food Sickness. |

| **Pheromone Extract** | Clean Water (1000 mB) +  Clutch of Pheromone Thoraxes (4) | Causes Infestations to act passive towards the player for 2 minutes. The infestation overlay from being near one can still damage the player. |
| **Swamp Broth** | Clean Water (1000 mB) +  Raw Snail Flesh +  Ball of Sap +  Flathead Mushroom (item) | Restores 0.2 saturation. Grants the  Elixir of Ripening II effect for 20 seconds, which restores the player's decay bar over time. |

| **Pear Cordial** | Clean Water (1000 mB) +  White Pear +  Sludge Ball +  Sap Spit | Restores 0.2 saturation. Reduces fall damage that the player takes down to 12.5% of the original damage for 20 seconds. |
| **Shaman's Brew** | Clean Water (1000 mB) +  Wisp +  Bulb-Capped Mushrooms +  Ground Mire Coral | Restores 0.2 saturation. Grants the  Hunter's Sense Brew II effect, which allows the player to see "scent trails" of mobs, and the vanilla  Night Vision II effect for 20 seconds each. |
| **Lake Broth** | Clean Water (1000 mB) +  Crab Claw +  Barnacle Flesh +  Raw Anadia Meat +  Ground Algae | Restores 0.2 saturation. Grants the vanilla  Water Breathing II effect for 20 seconds. |

Resets the Food Sickness values on all foods to 0 (unlike with Chiromaw Wings, this does *not* cause the tea to become sickening to drink itself). Spawns 4 Tiny Sludge Worm Helpers from the player, which will attack nearby aggressive and neutral mobs. |
