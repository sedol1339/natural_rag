Collection
------------

Pitcher Plants must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Pitcher Plant Trap, which can then be ground into Ground Pitcher Plant.

Growing
---------

Pitcher Plants will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Pitcher Plants have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 12. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
