**Life Crystals** are items containing charge that is useful in many processes, most notably animating.

They have two versions: A whole Life Crystal and a less powerful **Life Crystal Fragment**.

Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Whole Life Crystals drop from breaking Life Crystal Ore with any pickaxe.

A whole Life Crystal also drops from the Barrishee, with varying amounts of charge already drained.

### Loot
Life Crystal Fragments can be found as Loot from chests in Cragrock Towers, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

Uses
------

### Charge
Each Life Crystal or Life Crystal Fragment can hold a certain amount of durability, or "charge", represented as a charge percentage tooltip (out of 100%). The crystal stores this charge for use in various processes, but is drained by a varying amount of charge whenever it is used (indicated both in the crystal's tooltip percentage and its increasingly dark coloration). If it reaches 0 charge, or if it doesn't have enough charge required for the process, it will not function.

Life Crystals and Life Crystal Fragments have the following charge-based uses:

* One can be used in the Animator as a requirement for the animation process, draining a varying amount of charge per animation depending on what is being animated.
* One can be used optionally in the Mortar to automate the grinding process, draining 1 charge per grind.
* One can also be used optionally in the Infuser to automatically stir the liquid inside, draining 1 charge per *stir* (multiple stirs will usually occur throughout a single infusing process).

#### Recharging
Depleted, whole Life Crystals can be recharged by applying them with Wight's Hearts. Each heart applied to the Life Crystal restores 16 charge points to it, and any number between 1 and 8 can be crafted with the crystal at once (as long as the resulting charge is not higher than 128).

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Charges **Life Crystal** (16 charge per heart) | Shapeless: **Life Crystal** (less than full charge) + Wight's Heart (1-8) |  |

#### Fragment Differences
There are two differences between using whole Life Crystals and Life Crystal Fragments:

* Whole Life Crystals have a maximum charge of 128, whereas Life Crystal Fragments only have a maximum charge of 64.
* Whole Life Crystals can be recharged using Wight's Hearts, but Life Crystal Fragments cannot.

### Crafting Uses

| Swamp Talisman | **Life Crystal** (full charge) + Moss or Moss (item) or Cave Moss or Cave Moss (item) + Slimy Bone |  |
