Obtaining

### Collection
Drinkable Brew Fluids can be collected by right-clicking a Steeping Pot containing the corresponding Drinkable Brew Fluids with a bucket. Each bucket collects 1000 mB worth of fluid, meaning that every steeping process yields up to 4 Drinkable Brews.

Storing
---------

Drinkable Brew Fluids can be stored in Barrels, Filtered Silt Glass Jars, and Steeping Pots. They store 8, 4, and 1 bucket of fluid respectively. They can be extracted back into empty buckets, or turned into Drinkable Brews by shift-right clicking with a Weedwood Bowl.

Pheromone Extract
-------------------

A Grub Hub can be filled with Pheromone Extract via a bucket to farm Silk Grubs.
