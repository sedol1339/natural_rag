Collection
------------

Bog Beans must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Bog Bean Flower (item), which can then be ground into Ground Bog Bean.

Growing
---------

Bog Beans will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when their stalk is underwater and on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Bog Bean Flowers and Stalks have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
