Syrmorite Shears can also be used on Puffshrooms, instantly removing the trap from the block and causing it to drop Puffshroom Tendrils.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged pair of Syrmorite Shears can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Syrmorite Shears** | Damaged **Syrmorite Shears** + Sulfur (6-12) + Life Crystal (6-25% charge) |  |

Corrosion & Middle Gems

The Syrmorite Shears do not corrode, nor can they be applied with Middle Gems.
