Description

Sparks charging into a lightning bolt

Lightning in The Betweenlands works differently than it does in the Overworld. When lightning is about to strike an area, small parks will begin to form, giving off an electrical sound. The number and speed of the sparks increase over the course of about 10 seconds, before a lightning bolt finally strikes. Lightning strikes cause the sky to flash brightly, and can spawn fire around the impact site.

Lightning can be used to convert certain dropped items and entities into their lightning-based variants, although they will burn in the spawned fire if the hit is too direct or otherwise unprotected.

* If Lightning strikes one or more dropped Angler Tooth Arrow, Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrow, Octine Arrow, Basilisk Arrow, or Sludge Worm Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.
* If Lightning strikes the Chirobarb Erupter, it will transform into the Chirobarb Shock Erupter.
* If Lightning strikes a placed Chiromaw Hatchling, it will transform into a Lightning Chiromaw Hatchling.

Lightning will also frequently strike around a Draeton flying in a Thunderstorm, so be wary. A certain Simulacra effect also attracts lightning.

Thunderstorm can be manually triggered using the following command: /blevent <toggle/on/off> thebetweenlands:thunderstorm
