Rotten Bark ingame

**Rotten Bark** is a decayed wood block. It can be found as Giant Hollow Logs in Swamplands biomes, and as the outside layer block of Rotten Weedwood Trees. It can also be found in Sludge Plains Ruins and the Sludgeon Tower of the Sludgeon.

It also has a **Spreading** variant that generates from killed, naturally generated Spirit Trees.

Spreading

If the Large Spirit Tree Face of a naturally generated Spirit Tree is killed, the tree will begin to die. The Spirit Tree Logs of the tree will slowly convert into Spreading Rotten Bark, which acts the same as regular Rotten Bark, but spreads to the nearby logs of the tree.

Termites
----------

When broken, Rotten Bark has a chance to spawn a large Termite, which will proceed to attack the nearest player.

Fuel
------

Rotten Bark can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per bark block.

Compostability
----------------

Rotten Bark has a compost process time of 10 minutes and a compost amount of 25. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
