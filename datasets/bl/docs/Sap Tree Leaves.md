**Sap Tree Leaves** are the leaf blocks of Sap Trees.

Contents
--------

* 1 Particles
* 2 Decay
* 3 Collection
* 4 Compostability
* 5 Events
* 6 History

Particles
-----------

Small leaf particles will fall around Sap Tree Leaves.

Decay
-------

Like other leaves, natural Sap Tree Leaves spontaneously decay and disappear when they receive a block tick if they are not connected to any living wood block.

Sap Tree Leaves placed by the player will never naturally decay.

Collection
------------

When decayed or harvested normally, Sap Tree Leaves usually drop nothing, but have a chance to drop a Sap Tree Sapling. The leaf blocks themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Compostability
----------------

Sap Tree Leaves have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 4. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Sap Tree Leaves will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.

History
---------

* Alpha 3.1.0: Now have an alternative texture for the Winter event.
* Beta 1.0.2: Can now be sheared with Syrmorite Shears.
* **Beta 1.0.0**: Introduced.
