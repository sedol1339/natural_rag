Obtaining
-----------

### Filtering Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Peat** | Using Silt Crab: Moss + Anadia Remains |  |

### Generation
Peat generates in relatively large patches on the surface of Marsh biomes.

Properties
------------

### Plant Support
Peat supports the placement and growth of basic plants.

### Movement
Peat slows down the movement of players and non-Betweenlands mobs by a small amount when walked over. This slowing can be negated by wearing Rubber Boots or Boots of the Marsh Runner.

Betweenlands mobs are not slowed by Peat.

### Igniting
Peat will sustain fire that is on top of it indefinitely, until it is removed through manual means. To first ignite it, one must use an Octine Ingot on either a placed or dropped block of Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, or Thorns resting on top of the Peat.

#### Extinguishing
Extinguishing fire on top of Peat (either by left-clicking the fire to put it out or via other means) will turn the peat into Smoldering Peat.

### Events
Placed Peat will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.
