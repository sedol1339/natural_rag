Description
-------------

Emberling Shamans are nearly identical to their wild Emberling counterparts - they are fiery creatures that resemble salamander nymphs, differentiated from their aforementioned cousins by their bipedal stance, the orange-hot metal rods they carry, and the small whirl of fiery particles which constantly surrounds them.

Emberling Shamans are found at the top of the Sludgeon Tower; upon lighting all four of the Braziers and activating the Beam Origin, a shaman will spawn in the fire atop each Brazier and attack the player. Unlike Emberlings found in the wild, they cannot be tamed. When a player is in close proximity, they will leap into the air and spin towards them, dealing damage with melee attacks. If the player is too far away, however, the shaman will raise its staff and summon a flaming projectile that tracks towards the player. All of its attacks will set the player on fire.

Emberling Shamans will continue to spawn whenever the Beam Origin is activated, even after this has initially been done, granted that the puzzle in the Sludgeon Tower has not been completed.
