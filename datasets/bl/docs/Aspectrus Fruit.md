Infusing
----------

Each Aspectrus Fruit is imbued with the same Aspect the plant was grown in, displayed as part of the fruit's name and in its tooltip, if discovered. The amount of Aspect in each fruit is always 0.25, regardless of the value of the Aspect Vial used in the Censer.

Aspectrus Fruit can be used, alternatively to Ground Items, as an ingredient within the Infuser to create Infusions or Aspect Vials. *(See Herblore for more information on the infusing process)*

Mortar
--------

Aspectrus Fruit can be added directly to an Aspect Vial via a Mortar, avoiding the typical lengthy Aspect distillation process. To do so, simply place the fruit in the Mortar, and an Aspect Vial, either empty or of the same Aspect, into the rightmost output slot. When the Mortar is used, it will add 0.25 of the fruit's Aspect to the vial and consume the fruit.
