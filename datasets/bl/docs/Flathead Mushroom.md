Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Flathead Mushrooms generate in patches in Swamplands biomes and the Swamplands Clearing sub-biome.

They also generate around Chiromaw Matriarch Nests, in the Wight Fortress, and in the Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, Winding Walkways, Crypt Tunnels, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Growing
Flathead Mushrooms will grow to adjacent supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. The mushrooms themselves can be right-clicked with a Betweenlands Shovel to dig the block underneath it if applicable, and right-clicked with Compost to compost the dug block underneath. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

### Potting
Flathead Mushrooms can be right-clicked on Mud Brick Flower Pots to place them inside decoratively. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

### Events
Placed Flathead Mushrooms will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.

Drops
-------

When broken, Flathead Mushrooms drop a **Flathead Mushroom** item. The blocks themselves cannot be collected.

Item Properties
-----------------

### Planting
Flathead Mushroom items can be used to plant Flathead Mushrooms on solid blocks, as long as there is not another block directly above them.

### Consuming
When eaten, Flathead Mushroom items restore 3 hunger and 1.8 saturation. They also inflict the  Hunger II effect for 25 seconds.

Unlike most other foods, they are not affected by Food Sickness.

Uses
------

### Compostability
Both the block and item forms of Flathead Mushrooms can be composted in a Compost Bin. They have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost value of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
