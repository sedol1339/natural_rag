Grinding Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Limestone Flux** (3) | Limestone or Polished Limestone + Pestle (1 use) |  |

Ore Smelting
--------------

Limestone Flux can be placed in the additional far left slot/s of a Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace. Each smelt of Octine Ore or Syrmorite Ore in the furnace consumes one flux and gives the ore a small chance to yield two ingots rather than just one. Keep in mind that it only works with smelting these ores, not anything else.
