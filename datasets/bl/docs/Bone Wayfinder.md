It can be found as Loot from pots in Caverns, Lake Caverns, Ruins, and Underground Ruins, and from chests in Shrines, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.

Linking Menhirs
-----------------

An unlinked Bone Wayfinder can be right-clicked on a Menhir to link itself to that Menhir's location. The linked Wayfinder will then display an enchanted glint and the coordinates of the Menhir in its tooltip.

### Teleporting
Holding right-click with the linked Bone Wayfinder from anywhere in The Betweenlands with exposure to the open sky will begin charging the Wayfinder. During this process, the player is slowed considerably, and taking damage will cause it to reset. After about five seconds of holding down right-click, the player will teleport back to the general location of the Menhir the Wayfinder was linked to.

Note that, while charging for teleportation, the Bone Wayfinder will drain a small amount of the player's experience, and so it requires a sufficient amount in order to be used. In addition, upon teleporting, the player will be afflicted with Blindness II () for 3 seconds, and the Wayfinder will have lost one point of durability.

Linked Bone Wayfinders can also be placed on an Offering Table to allow multiple players to teleport with the same Wayfinder. To do so, simply hold crouch next to the Table. Note that this will still consume XP and durability. Wayfinders placed on an Offering Table do not require sky access to function.

When shift right-clicked, the Bone Wayfinder will open an interface where a custom name for the Wayfinder can be input and saved, allowing for easy organization.

A linked Bone Wayfinder can be unlinked by crafting it alone, like so:

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlinks **Bone Wayfinder** | Linked **Bone Wayfinder** |  |

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Bone Wayfinder can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Bone Wayfinder** | Damaged **Bone Wayfinder** + Sulfur (11-30) + Life Crystal (15-29% charge) |  |
