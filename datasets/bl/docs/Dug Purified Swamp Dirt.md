Obtaining
-----------

### Digging
Dug Purified Swamp Dirt is created by right-clicking on the top of Purified Swamp Dirt with a Betweenlands Shovel.

Properties
------------

### Composting
Right-clicking on Dug Purified Swamp Dirt with Compost will fill the hole in the dirt with compost, allowing crops to be planted on it and plants to grow on it.

### Plant Support
Dug Purified Swamp Dirt supports the placement and growth of basic plants. In addition, it supports the spread of Swamp Grass, which will turn it into Dug Purified Swamp Grass.

When composted, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt supports the growth of White Pear Plants by planting White Pear Seeds, Yellow Dotted Fungus by planting Spores, and Aspectrus Plants by planting Aspectrus Seeds on a Rubber Tree Plank Fence on top of it.

Composted Dug Purified Swamp Dirt also allows basic plants placed on it to grow to other plant-supporting blocks adjacent to the composted block.

Note that the compost inside the Dug Purified Swamp Dirt will be depleted after enough crop or plant harvests from it. It will also revert to regular Dug Swamp Dirt after three harvests of a fully grown plant. Letting grass spread over the block first will turn it into Dug Purified Swamp Grass, which lasts for six harvests.

### Decay
Dug Purified Swamp Dirt that is not composted will eventually revert to regular Purified Swamp Dirt if it is left unfilled.

Unlike Dug Swamp Dirt and Dug Swamp Grass, composted Dug Purified Swamp Dirt will never decay, and crops growing on it will never decay either.

Drops
-------

Dug Purified Swamp Dirt drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The block itself cannot be collected in Survival Mode.
