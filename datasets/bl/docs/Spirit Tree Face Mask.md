**Spirit Tree Face Masks** are special placeable and wearable items. There are two varieties - Small, which is a rare drop from Small Spirit Tree Faces and has an Animated variant; and Large, which is a reward for defeating the Large Spirit Tree Face if the average strength level determined by the Wisps surrounding the Spirit Tree is sufficient.

Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small Animated Spirit Tree Face Mask | Small Spirit Tree Face Mask + Sulfur (24) + Life Crystal (19% charge) |  |

Placement
-----------

Both inanimate Spirit Tree Face Masks can be placed decoratively on the sides of blocks. The Small Mask only takes up one block side, whereas the Large Mask requires a two-by-two area. Both placed Masks can be reclaimed simply by hitting them.

Stats
-------

The inanimate masks are wearable and have a unique overlay over the player's first-person vision when worn, similar to the effect of wearing a Pumpkin. Small Spirit Tree Faces become passive towards the wearer. However, the Large Mask additionally inflicts a Slowness () effect on the wearer while worn.

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, both inanimate Spirit Tree Face Masks can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using them. The type of gem equipped can be seen in their tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
