  reference_answers:
  - The non-Betweenlands tools and weapons are much less effective here, so you need
    to craft Betweenlands tools, weapons and armour. You need to collect multiple
    varieties of foods, such as mushrooms, to Food Sickness. You need Balls of Sap
    or Weeping Blue Petals to restore a Decay bar. You need sulfur torches to see
    better in the dark. You may need Swamp Reeds for other useful tools such as Buckets.

  - This is the decay bar. Simply existing in the dimension slowly causes it to decrease.
    As decay points drop, the player's maximum health is reduced and slowness is applied.
    You need to consume Balls of Sap that is harvested them from the Sap Tree, or

    There are also other sources to replenish the decay bar.
