Properties
------------

### Movement
When not jumping, Rubber Blocks slow down players and mobs that walk over them by a considerable amount. This slowing cannot be negated in any way.

### Bouncing
Like vanilla Slime Blocks, Rubber Blocks bounce back players and mobs that jump on top of them at a fraction of their initial velocity, negating fall damage in the process. This bouncing effect can be canceled by holding Shift.
