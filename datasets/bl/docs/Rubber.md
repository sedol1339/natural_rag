Physics

Rubber acts similarly to vanilla Water, and flows at the same speed. However, its flow has no current force, and it slows down players and mobs swimming in it. It also cannot create infinite source blocks.

Drowning
----------

Rubber will begin drowning players and mobs that are completely submerged in it, after draining their breath meter. It deals 2 damage () per drowning tick.

Collection
------------

Rubber can be collected with a Weedwood or Syrmorite Bucket.
