Properties
------------

### Aspects
Every Ground Item (*except* for Ground Betweenstone Pebbles) contains one or more Aspects, although these are not immediately displayed to the player and must first be discovered through testing a Gecko in a Gecko Cage. The Aspects discovered on a Ground Item can be viewed by holding Shift while hovering over the item in the inventory, displaying each Aspect's type, icon, and decimal amount value.

The types of Aspects found on a Ground Item are randomized based on world seed, with the exception of a few items:

* Ground Middle Gems will always contain one specific Aspect *only*. Ground Aqua Middle Gem always contains Byrginaz, Ground Crimson Middle Gem always contains Firnalaz, and Ground Green Middle Gem always contains Fergalaz.
* Ground Items derived from a few semi-exclusive plants, specifically Ground Cryptweed, Edge Leaf, Edge Moss, Edge Shroom, Pale Grass, Rotbulb, and String Roots, will always contain Wodren and/or Uduriis in addition to other random Aspects. They are also the only Ground Items that can contain these Aspects.

Note that the Aspects of these items still have to be discovered normally to be viewed.

Each Ground Item also has a rarity tier that determines the tier of the Aspects they contain. For example, Tier I items will only contain Tier I Aspects. The number of Aspects that can be found on each item also generally follows its tier (more common plants tend to have greater numbers of lower tier Aspects, while rarer plants have fewer numbers of higher tier Aspects).

Uses
------

### Testing
Any Ground Item containing Aspects can be right-clicked on a Gecko in a Gecko Cage to feed it, discovering one of the item's Aspects in the process. An Herblore Book must also be in the player's inventory to record the results. When experimenting with an item, a message will display in chat, noting how the Gecko reacts, and an entry in the Herblore Book will also be added/updated on the ingredient and aspect. A second message will display to indicate whether more testing is required to learn the remaining Aspects, or if all Aspects on the item have been discovered.

### Infusing
Any Ground Item containing Aspects can be right-clicked on an Infuser filled with Swamp Water to add it as an Infusing ingredient. Combining ingredients in the Infuser process and collecting the resulting brew yields an Infusion Bucket with the total Aspects and amount values of the combination. These Infusion Buckets can then be distilled in the Alembic to produce Infusions or Aspect Vials, depending on whether the mixture was valid or not. Aspect Vials can be used as single-Aspect alternatives to Ground Items, as the Aspect they contain is isolated from other potentially unwanted Aspects and already known without the need to experiment with Geckos.

### Compostability
All Ground Items have a compost process time of 3 minutes and 20 seconds and a compost amount of 3. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

### Igniting
Ground Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, and Thorns can be used to create fire by holding right-click on their dropped form with an Octine Ingot.
