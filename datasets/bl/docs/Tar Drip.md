Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Tar Drips can drop commonly from Tar Beasts, and rarely from Crypt Crawlers, upon death.

### Loot
Tar Drips can be found as Loot from Pots of Chance in Tar Pool Dungeons.

Uses
------

### Tarring
A Tar Drip can be right-clicked on a normal Weedwood Rowboat to tar it, turning it into a Tarred Weedwood Rowboat which does not drift randomly and is therefore easier to control.

### Crafting Uses
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weedwood Barrel | **Tar Drip** + Weedwood Plank Slab (2) + Syrmorite Ingot (2) + Weedwood Bucket + Weedwood Planks (3) |  |
| Tar Beast Heart | **Tar Drip** (8) + Wight's Heart |  |
| Lurker Skin Patch (4) | Shapeless: **Tar Drip** + Lurker Skin |  |
| Tarminion | **Tar Drip** (8) + Animated Tar Beast Heart |  |

#### Modifying Fish Bait
Tar Drips can be used to increase the dissolve time of a Fish Bait. Each Tar Drip applied to the bait adds 20 ticks (1 second) to its dissolve time. Any number between 1 and 8 can be crafted with the bait at once, and it can be optionally crafted in combination with any number of other items that modify the bait.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adds dissolve time to Fish Bait (20 per piece) | Shapeless: **Tar Drip** (1-8) + Fish Bait + Other modifier items (0-7) |  |
