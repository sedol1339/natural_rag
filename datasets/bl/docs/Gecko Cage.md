The Gecko Cage ingame

The **Gecko Cage** is a craftable utility block that houses Geckos, primarily with the intention of conducting tests on them to discover Aspects. In addition to being crafted, it can also be found as part of Sludge Plains Ruins.

Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gecko Cage** | Syrmorite Ingot (4) + Weedwood Plank Slab (2) + Reed Rope (3) |  |

Caging Geckos
---------------

Geckos can be captured by the player by right-clicking them with a Net. They will then appear in the player's inventory as an item, which can be right-clicked on a Gecko Cage to put the captured Gecko inside.

While inside, the Gecko will retain the statistics it had before it was caged. If the Gecko Cage is broken while it is inside, the Gecko will be released as a mob, with the appropriate statistics (which may be different depending on how much the Gecko was tested on).

Gecko Testing
---------------

The Aspects that can be found on items used in Herblore are, in most cases, randomized among these items per world seed, instead of always being found on the same item. Which aspects are on what item is also not displayed to the player immediately. Testing Ground Items on Geckos allows the player to discover which Aspects are on what item, so that they can understand what items are needed to create specific Infusions and Aspect Vials.

To test a Ground Item on a caged Gecko, right-click the item on the Gecko Cage with the testing Gecko. An Herblore Book must also be in the inventory while doing this to record the results. The Gecko will react in a certain way, depending on what Aspect was discovered, and a corresponding message will display describing the reaction. An entry in the Herblore Book on the aspect will also be added.

From then on, ***the discovered Aspect can be viewed on the Ground Item that was tested by pressing shift while hovering over the item.*** The aspect's icon and amount value will also be displayed.

Each Gecko experiment will only discover one Aspect, even if the Ground Item tested contains more than one. A second message will display when conducting an experiment based on whether or not there are still more aspects on that item to be discovered:

* If there are still more aspects to be discovered, the message, "This item still seems to have some more undiscovered aspects" will be displayed.
* If all aspects on the item have been discovered, the message, "This seems to be the last undiscovered aspect on this item" will be displayed.

After each experimentation, the test Gecko will need about 30 seconds to recover before it can be tested on again. Attempting to test a Gecko before it has recovered will display the message, "The gecko is still recovering from the last experiment." Each experiment will also deal 1 damage () to the Gecko, and once drained of its total health the Gecko will die and will have to be replaced to continue testing.

List of Gecko Reactions
-------------------------

The following is a list of Aspects, the Gecko reaction message they invoke when discovered, and any possible visual changes made to the Gecko as part of the reaction. What the messages describe is not necessarily visible on the Gecko unless specified.
