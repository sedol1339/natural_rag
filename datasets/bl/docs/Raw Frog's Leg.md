Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Raw Frog's Legs drop from Frogs upon death (as long as they are not on fire).

They can also drop from looting Greebling Corpses.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Raw Frog's Legs restore 2 hunger and 0.8 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Raw Frog's Legs have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Raw Frog's Legs have a 25% chance to restore only 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Raw Frog's Legs have a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, they can be right-clicked onto the juvenile to feed it.
