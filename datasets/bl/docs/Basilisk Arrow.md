Obtaining
-----------

### Loot
Basilisk Arrows can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underwater Ruins, Underground Ruins, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Urns of Chance in Sludge Plains Ruins and the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Dungeon Alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues, Shrines, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Shooting
Like vanilla Arrows, Basilisk Arrows can be shot from any Bow, including a Weedwood Bow or Predator Bow. The velocity they are shot at depends on how far back the bow is pulled, as well as how corroded it is. The arrows deal damage based on their velocity to whatever entity they hit. If they do not hit an entity, they will instead stick into the block they land on and can then be picked up, but will eventually despawn if left untouched.

Additionally, shot Basilisk Arrows inflict the  Petrify II effect upon entities they hit, preventing them from moving and disabling screen camera movement on players. The effect lasts for 5 seconds on most entities, but only lasts for 2 seconds on most bosses (besides Spirit Tree Faces), and cannot be inflicted whatsoever upon the Chiromaw Matriarch.

Uses
------

### Lightning Effects
If Betweenlands Lightning strikes one or more dropped Basilisk Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.
