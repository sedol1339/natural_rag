Usage
-------

Right-click an Item Frame with an item to put the item on display. Right-click again to rotate the item.

Shift-right-click an Item Frame with Glowing Goop to give it a glowing effect.

Shift-right-click an Item Frame with a Freiwynn Dentrothyst Vial to make it invisible. The invisibility effect is only applied while the frame is displaying an item, and will reappear when the item is taken out. However, the effect still stays, and the frame will disappear again once something else is placed in it.
