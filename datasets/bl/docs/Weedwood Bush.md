Coloration
------------

Weedwood Bushes take on different foliage colors depending on what biome they are in. The foliage color is:

* #48B518 if in the inventory
* #A8A800 to  #A87800 in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #63B581 in Marsh biomes
* #00AD7C in Patchy Islands biomes
* #D36423 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #52AF5A to  #85AF51 in Swamplands biomes
* #52AF5A in Swamplands Clearing biomes

Movement
----------

Players are capable of standing in Weedwood Bushes and walking through them at a slowed speed. This allows them in certain cases to hide from attacking mobs, as most cannot travel through the bush themselves. Note that moving through a bush creates bursts of leaf particles and loud rustling noises, which may attract another player's attention.

Geckos
--------

Geckos are capable of fleeing into and hiding inside Weedwood Bushes. They will come out after 2 minutes of being undisturbed, or if the bush block they are hiding in is destroyed.

Collection
------------

When harvested normally, Weedwood Bushes drop Weedwood Sticks.

Weedwood Bushes themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Growing
---------

Weedwood Bushes will grow to adjacent blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Weedwood Bushes have a compost process time of 10 minutes and a compost amount of 20. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Infesting
-----------

Weedwood Bushes can be Infested by right-clicking them with a Pheromone Thorax. Infested Weedwood Bushes are then used to grow Silk Grubs. If right-clicked with a Thorax Clutch, they will die and spawn an Infestation. They can also be infested with a Grub Hub and Pheromone Extract.

Events
--------

Placed Weedwood Bushes will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
