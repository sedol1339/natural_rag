The spooky face in the sky

**Spook** is a Halloween-themed seasonal event. It primarily changes a variety of aesthetic elements in The Betweenlands.

The Spook event only occurs naturally in the Betweenlands during approximately the last week of October in real time, and will go away afterwards. It is constantly active during this time, unless turned off manually.

Effects
---------

When the Spook event first starts, text will appear above the player's HUD, saying "You feel a chill in the air...the haunting season has begun!"

While the Spook event is active, a variety of natural blocks' textures change when placed to a spookier looking theme. For example, many grasses and Weedwood Trees will turn autumn colored, while Rubber Trees will turn a ghostly white, Sap Trees will ooze with blood, and Roots and Giant Roots will turn into creepy tentacles.

The following blocks' textures will change:

* Blue Eyed Grass
* Cattail, Cragrock
* Double Swamp Tallgrass
* Giant Root (block)
* Hanger
* Moss, Mossy Cragrock Bottom, Mossy Cragrock Top
* Phragmites, Poison Ivy
* Root, Rubber Tree Leaves, Rubber Tree Log
* Sap Tree Leaves, Sap Tree Log, Seeded Hanger, Shelf Fungus, Sludge (block), Sludgy Dirt, Soft Rush, Swamp Reed, Swamp Tallgrass
* Tall Cattail
* Weedwood Leaves, Weedwood Log

Sludges and Smol Sludges will also have their skull face replaced with a Jack o'Lantern face.

In addition to the texture changes, the sky will turn a foggy orange color, and a spooky jack o'lantern face will appear in the sky. The normal ambient sounds for the entire dimension will also be replaced by an alternative Halloween-themed ambient track, and Music will not play during the event either.

While the Spook event is primarily aesthetic, there is one gameplay change: Most neutral and hostile mobs from the Betweenlands will have a chance to drop one of three Candies if killed by a player.

### Manual Control
The Spook event can be manually turned/toggled on and off using the following command:

```
/blevent <toggle|on|off> thebetweenlands:spook
```
