There are three varieties: **Rootman**, **Deepman**, and **Lake Cavern** (each of which is split into three variants).

Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Simulacra generate in different parts of the world, depending on their type. Deepman Simulacra generate in the Cavern layer, Lake Cavern Simulacra generate in the Lake Cavern layer, and Rootman Simulacra generate on the Giant Roots holding up Raised Islands in Raised Isles biomes.

Simulacra may generate with lit Mud Brick Flower Pots with Candles nearby, and they may also be found with an Offering Table placed next to them. This table may be empty, or it may contain a Reed Donut, Jam Donut, Weeping Blue Petal, White Pear, Sap Ball, Forbidden Fig, or Spirit Fruit.

Properties
------------

### Breaking
Breaking the Simulacra will play a deep "donk," most likely to spook the player, but has no other noticeable effects. This only plays once when first picked up, however, suggesting that this may be to indicate it is now active (see Effects).

### Effects
Simulacra *may* have one of many interesting effects, though the player will have to experiment to figure out what kind of Simulacrum they've found. Simulacrum effects are *not* determined by the Simulacrum's type and are randomly chosen. Any effect the Simulacrum has will not be active until after a player has first broken it and placed it down again.

When shift right-clicked while held in the inventory, the Simulacrum will open an interface where a custom name for it can be input and saved, making it easy to organize Simulacra based on their discovered effects.

The following content is a list of Simulacrum effects and is hidden below in a spoiler tab.

| Simulacrum Effects (SPOILER WARNING) | |
| --- | --- |
| **Effect Name** | **Description** |
| None | No effect. |
| Random | Changes to a random other effect periodically. |
| Them | Increases "Them" appearances during the Dense Fog event. |
| Imitation | Imitates the sounds of the last killed mob. |
| Weakness | Reduces mining speed in a radius. |
| Resurrection | Has a chance to resurrect a mob that dies nearby. |
| Sanctuary | Extends nearby Repeller shields. |
| Fertility | Spawns Mire Snails during the Heavy Rain event. |
| Attraction | Attracts lightning from the Thunderstorm event. |
| Wisp | Generates Wisps during the Auroras event. Wisps nearby are always visible. |
| Wisdom | Spawns experience orbs which can increase or decrease your XP. |
| Blessing | Offer a Spirit Fruit on a nearby Offering Table and it will generate a shower of blue particles around itself when a player gets near it. Upon standing in the particles for a few seconds, the Spirit Fruit will be consumed, and the player will be granted the  Blessed effect, which prevents them from dying once, leaving them with 50% of their maximum health remaining. However, there is a twist - either the player will be revived on the spot, *or* they will be teleported back to the Offering Table's location in the process and be inflicted with the  Blindness II effect for 3 seconds. Additionally, revival consumes all of the player's XP and drops only a fraction of it, if any, at the point where they would have died. The Blessed effect will not go away until 10 seconds after being revived, and more Spirit Fruits will not be consumed from the Offering Table until the effect is no longer active. |

A Simulacrum's effect can also be viewed as a tooltip in the inventory while in Creative Mode.

Uses
------

### Fuel
All variants of Rootman Simulacra can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per simulacrum.
