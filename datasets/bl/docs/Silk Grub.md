Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Silk Grubs drop from breaking Silk Grub Infested Weedwood Bushes.

### Shearing
Silk Grubs are harvested by shearing a Silk Grub Infested Weedwood Bush with Syrmorite Shears, turning it into a regular Weedwood Bush in the process. This yields twice as many grubs as breaking or automatically harvesting the bush.

### Grub Collecting
Silk Grubs are automatically and near-instantly collected by a Grub Hub from any Silk Grub Infested Weedwood Bushes within a 3x3 block radius of the block below it, turning them into regular Weedwood Bushes. The Grub Hub can hold up to a full stack of grubs at once, and will stop collecting if it is full.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, Silk Grubs restore 1 hunger and 0.2 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Silk Grubs have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Silk Grubs have a 25% chance to restore 1 hunger () when eaten, and a 75% chance to not restore any hunger at all.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Silk Producing
Silk Grubs can be right-clicked on a Moth House to put them inside, allowing it to produce Silk Threads over time. Each grub can produce a maximum of 3 Silk Threads before being used up, and up to 6 grubs can be inside a Moth House at once - right-clicking will put inside as many grubs in the stack as can fit at once. The rate at which the grubs produce silk depends on the efficiency of the Moth House, which can be augmented by placing Lanterns nearby.
