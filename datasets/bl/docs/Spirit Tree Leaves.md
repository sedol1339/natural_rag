Spirit Tree Leaves ingame

**Spirit Tree Leaves** are the leaf blocks of both natural and sapling-grown Spirit Trees. They come in a **Top** variant, as well as **Middle** and **Bottom** variants that droops down from it.

They appear drooping like a willow, and occasionally emit small, white butterfly particles.

Placement
-----------

While the Top variant can be placed anywhere, the Middle variant can only be placed on the underside of the Top variant or itself, and the Bottom variant can only be placed on the underside of the Middle variant. Breaking a higher part of a growth of leaves will break all parts below it as well.

Climbing
----------

The edges of Spirit Tree Leaves can be climbed similarly to Climbing Rope, while the center is solid, and can support a player.

Decay
-------

Like other leaves, the Top variants of natural Spirit Tree Leaves spontaneously decay and disappear if they are not connected to any living wood block (based on random ticks).

On the naturally generated Spirit Tree, they will begin to decay once the Large Spirit Tree Face is killed, as the Spirit Tree Logs supporting them will slowly turn into Spreading Rotten Bark.

Spirit Tree Leaves placed by the player will never naturally decay, even without a supporting log.

Collection
------------

When decayed or broken normally, Spirit Tree Leaves usually drop nothing, but have a chance to drop a Spirit Fruit. The leaf blocks themselves must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected.

Unlike with other trees, Spirit Tree Saplings are not dropped from Spirit Tree Leaves, and instead only drop from the Large Spirit Tree Face when killed.

Compostability
----------------

Spirit Tree Leaves have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

History
---------

* Beta 3.5.0: Are now compostable.
