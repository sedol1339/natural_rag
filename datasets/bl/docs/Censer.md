Properties
------------

### Censing
The Censer interface. Each part is colour-coded based on the coloured text to the left.

The interface can be accessed by right-clicking the Censer:

* The effect-item, which is placed in the left slot of the interface.
* Sulfur, which is placed in the bottom slot. Like a Sulfur Furnace, the Censer will stop working once it runs out of fuel.

Once these requirements are met, the Censer will begin consuming the Sulfur, then the item put in the left slot will begin to fill the middle slot, emitting a ground-fog effect.

Like other blocks, the Syrmorite Hopper can automate the process of fueling and filling the Censer.

The area of the effect can vary depending on the item used, as shown below.

The Censer emitting a field of Bottled Fog.

The Censer emitting a small cloud of Plant Tonic.

### Effects
* Sap Ball: (1 item to fill, lasts indefinitely, but duration depletes by half per decay point restored) Emits a small brown puff and slowly heals Decay in a large area (32x18x32).
* Weeping Blue Petal: (1 item to fill, lasts indefinitely, but duration depletes by 1/6th per 2 decay points restored) Emits a small blue puff and slowly heals decay in a large area (32x18x32).
* Plant Tonic: (1 item to fill, \_\_ minute duration when full) Emits a small brown cloud and prevents crops from decaying and removes existing decay in a medium area (16x5x16).
* Elixir: (1 item to fill, 16 minute duration when full) Emits a small cloud the colour of the Elixir and continuously applies a weak version of the Elixir, with a duration of 14 seconds (regardless of the Elixir's duration) in a large area. Potency affects range (default at level 1 is 32x18x32).
* Stagnant Water: (1 item to fill, 25 minute duration when full) Emits a thick yellow-green fog and continuously applies the Elixir of Decay effect, causing Decay to be accelerated in a small area (13x2x13).
* Bottled Fog: (8 items to fill, 120 minute duration when full) Emits a thick white fog and increases crop growth and allows Sludgeon plants to grow in a small area (13x2x13). Stackable.
* Aspect: (5 aspect levels to fill [must be combined in 1 bottle], 90 minute duration when full) Emits a thick fog of the aspect's colour and infuses Aspectrus crops with the aspect, also enabling them to grow in a small area (13x3x13).
* Cremains: (1 item to fill, 2.5 minute duration when full) Emits a dark red cloud and sets fire to any living creature in a small area, causing them to drop 0-2 cremains upon death, along with their usual on-fire drops (13x13x13).
* Swamp Water: (8 items to fill, 60 minute duration when full. Duration only decreases when Bark Amulet is added) Emits a cloud of white steam that carries the effect of the item it is imbued with in a large area (~48x\_x48?).
  + Can be imbued with a Bark Amulet. For that, place the Bark Amulet in the left slot, then right-click the Censer with a Swamp Water Bucket. It will show the life of the mobs the same way as it would do if you were wearing it.
