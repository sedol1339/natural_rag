Hangers ingame

**Hangers** are vine-like plants that hang off of the canopies of Hearthgrove and whole Giant Weedwood Trees, as well as from the underside of natural Giant Roots and the ceilings of Caverns and Lake Caverns. There are two variations - A normal Hanger, and a Seeded Hanger that only generates naturally on Giant Weedwood Trees.

Placement
-----------

Hangers can only be placed on the underside of solid blocks and leaves, as well as directly below themselves. Breaking a higher part of the Hanger vine will break all parts below it as well.

Coloration
------------

Hangers and Seeded Hangers take on different foliage colors depending on what biome they are in. The foliage color is:

* #A8A800 to  #A87800 in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #63B581 in Marsh biomes
* #00AD7C in Patchy Islands biomes
* #D36423 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #52AF5A to  #85AF51 in Swamplands biomes
* #52AF5A in Swamplands Clearing biomes

Collection
------------

Normal Hangers are harvested more effectively with an Axe, but must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Hanger (item), which can then be ground into Ground Hanger.

Seeded Hangers are unique in that they drop White Pear Seeds when harvested normally, which can be grown into an edible crop. However, they instead have the same drops as regular Hangers when using Syrmorite Shears or a Sickle.

Seeded Hangers can only be collected using a Silk Touch tool, although right clicking a Hanger with a White Pear will turn it into a seeded hanger.

Growth
--------

Hangers and Seeded Hangers that have been placed by the player will grow downward like Vines. However, all newly grown Hangers will be the normal variant, so it is impossible for any Hanger to grow more Seeded Hangers.

Compostability
----------------

Hangers and Seeded Hangers have a compost process time of 4 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 3. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Hangers and Seeded Hangers will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
