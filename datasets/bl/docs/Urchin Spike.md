Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Urchin Spikes drop from Freshwater Urchins upon death.

Uses
------

### Upgrading
Urchin Spikes can be used as an upgrade for any piece of Amphibious Armor by shift right-clicking the armor piece and placing the item in one or more of its upgrade slots (up to 3 can be placed in each slot). Having a slot with an Urchin Spike upgrade causes the armor piece to have a 15% chance each time the player is attacked to reflect 1-4 (-) damage back upon the attacker when equipped. Each additional armor piece with an Urchin Spike upgrade equipped increases the chance for damage reflection by 15% and increases the range of reflected damage dealt by 1 ().

Each Urchin Spike item at the top of an upgrade stack will receive durability damage when the armor itself is damaged, and will retain this durability loss even if taken out of the armor, becoming unstackable with other Urchin Spike items. Each item has a maximum durability of 64 before breaking, and the armor will then start using the next item down if it was stacked.
