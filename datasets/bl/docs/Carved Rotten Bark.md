Fuel
------

Any variant of Carved Rotten Bark can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per bark block.

Notes
-------

* Carved Rotten Bark that generates in the Labyrinthine Vaults may be rigged as a falling block, meaning it has a chance to fall if a player walks on or underneath it. A falling block can be indicated by the particles falling from it. The block will become unprotected after it falls.
  + Bark in the Crypt Tunnels is always rigged to fall, and it will plug the Crypt Crawler Tunnel Entrance it falls on in the process, stopping it from spawning Crypt Crawlers.
