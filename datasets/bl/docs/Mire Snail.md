Description
-------------

Mire Snails appear as snails with ochre colored, overgrown shells. They move slowly. Being passive, they do not attack the player, but do move in random directions when hit. They can be led and/or bred with Sludge Balls or Sap Spit, and will lay a Mire Snail Egg during this process. The egg will appear to 'breathe' and after a certain amount of in-game time it will hatch into another Mire Snail.

Mire Snails can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

Drops
-------

The drops from Mire Snails are derived from the mire\_snail loot table.
