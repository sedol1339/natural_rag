Stats
-------

A full set of Amphibious Armor provides 7 armor points, or 3.5 armor icons, and absorbs 28% of damage from the player at the expense of durability. Aside from block breaking speed, the armor provides the same set bonuses as Lurker Skin Armor.

Upgrades
----------

Amphibious Armor can be upgraded with upgrades obtained from Fishing, Anadia Parts, or  Middle Gems. Each upgrade has a **durability** of 64.

Shift right click with an Amphibious Armor piece in hand to access the armor piece’s **upgrade menu.** The Helmet and Boots have 3 slots, while the Chestplate and Leggings have 5 slots. Adding multiple of the same upgrade makes that upgrade stronger.

Use a Biopathic Trigger or Toggle to activate or toggle the upgrades.

| Upgrade | Slot | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Electric Upgrade | Chestplate | Zaps attackers or nearby mobs for up to 5 damage per mob. |
| Glide Upgrade | Chestplate | Sprint in air to glide. |
| Urchin Spike Upgrade | Chestplate | Attacks enemies with urchin spikes for up to 10 damage. |
| Fish Vortex Upgrade | Chestplate | Raises enemies in the air. |
| Ascent Upgrade | Leggings | Leap up to 10 blocks out of the water by sneaking on the floor for 1 second. |
| Anadia Eye | Helmet | Applies Night Vision underwater. |
| Anadia Gills | Helmet/Chestplate | Extends water breathing time. |
| Snot | Chestplate | Increases underwater mining speed. |
| Anadia Swim Bladder | Chestplate/Leggings | Increases swim speed when moving up or down. |

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, any damaged piece of Amphibious Armor can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Amphibious Armor** piece | Any damaged **Amphibious Armor** piece + Sulfur (4-8) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

Applying Middle Gems to this armor set is different from other sets. Multiple same-colored Middle Gems can be applied to each armor piece through the upgrade menu, rather than combining them in a crafting grid. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the armor as well as in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

Corrosion
-----------

Amphibious Armor does not corrode.
