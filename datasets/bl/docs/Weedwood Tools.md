| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

### Crypt Crawlers
Crypt Crawlers can sometimes spawn equipped with a Weedwood Sword or Weedwood Axe. The equipment has a chance to drop from the Crypt Crawler if killed by a player.

Properties
------------

### Usage
Weedwood Tools have similar base damage, attack speed and mining speed to wooden tools. Like all Betweenlands tools, Weedwood Tools deal more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools. The Weedwood Pickaxe is the first available pickaxe capable of mining Betweenstone, Sulfur Ore, and Slimy Bone Ore.

Unlike wooden tools, there is no Weedwood Hoe, as farming in the Betweenlands involves Compost instead.

### Repairing
Like most other equipment with durability, damaged Weedwood Tools can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Weedwood Tool** | Any damaged **Weedwood Tool** + Sulfur (4-8) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

### Corrosion
Weedwood Tools are made in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having them in your inventory will cause them to start corroding; using and swinging them as well as being in water will increase their rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases their damage output and mining effectiveness.

A corroded Weedwood Tool can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from corresponding **Weedwood Tool** | Any corroded and uncoated **Weedwood Tool** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A tool can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats corresponding **Weedwood Tool** (75 points per piece) | Any **Weedwood Tool** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded tool can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a tool that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from corresponding **Weedwood Tool** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Weedwood Tool** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

### Middle Gems
As with most equipment, Weedwood Tools can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using them. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the sword, and in the tooltip of all tools. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to corresponding **Weedwood Tool** | Any **Weedwood Tool** + Any Middle Gem |  |
