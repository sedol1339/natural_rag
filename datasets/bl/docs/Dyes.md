**Dyes** are items used in making various dyed blocks and items, primarily for decorative purposes.

There are 16 varieties of Dye, which are a different selection of colors from vanilla Dyes. They are for the most part made using certain Ground Items, and are obtained through a slightly more complicated process via steeping.

Obtaining
-----------

### Collection
Any Dye item can be collected by right-clicking a Steeping Pot containing the corresponding Dye fluid with a Weedwood Bowl. Each bowl collects 250 mB worth of fluid, meaning that every steeping process yields up to 4 Dye items.

See the Steeping page for more information on how to make Dye fluids.
