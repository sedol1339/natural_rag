**Giant Roots** are massive, twisting root formations that generate in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes. These roots are often covered in leaves and fungus, as well as moss and the various other plants found in the biome. They are capable of reaching great heights, and in some cases stretching out into neighboring biomes.
