Crafting Recipes
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weedwood Barrel | Syrmorite Ingot (2) + Weedwood Planks (3) + Weedwood Plank Slab (2) + Tar Drip + Weedwood Bucket (empty) |  |
| Syrmorite Barrel | Syrmorite Ingot (8) + Weedwood Barrel |  |

How to Use
------------

Right-clicking on a Barrel with a Bucket or Vial of almost any liquid will fill the Barrel by one level. The liquid can be retrieved again by Right-clicking the Barrel with an empty Bucket or Vial respectively.

Right-clicking the Barrel without a bucket will bring up an interface showing how much liquid is in the Barrel. The amount of liquid is also represented visually in the Barrel's model.

Barrels can store up to eight buckets worth of liquid; Swamp Water, Stagnant Water, Tar, Rubber, Shallowbreath, Bottled Fog, and even vanilla water and lava, although lava can only be stored in Syrmorite Barrels. The only liquids that can't be stored in a Barrel are milk and Infusions. When picked up, a barrel will retain the liquid held inside of it, allowing it to be placed again without losing its contents.
