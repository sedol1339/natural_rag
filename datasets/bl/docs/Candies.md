Obtaining

### Drops
All Candies can drop from most non-passive mobs from The Betweenlands upon death if killed by a player during the Spook seasonal event, at varying rates. Mobs that can drop them include Anglers, Blood Snails, Chiromaws, Crypt Crawlers, Emberlings, Emberling Shamans, Shallowbreaths, Large Sludge Worms, Leeches, Lurkers, Peat Mummies, Pyrads, Silt Crabs, Bubbler Crabs, Sludges, Smol Sludges, Small Sludge Worms, Swamp Hags, Tar Beasts, Termites, Tiny Sludge Worms, Wights, Chiromaw Matriarchs, the Dreadful Peat Mummy, the Primordial Malevolence, and the Sludge Menace.

Properties
------------

### Consuming
When eaten, all Candies restore 4 hunger and 4 saturation.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, all Candies have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, any Candy only restores 1 hunger () when eaten, a third of the original hunger value (rounded down).

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.
