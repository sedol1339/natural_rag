**Druid Circles** are Overworld structures that generate commonly in any Overworld biome defined as a Swamp biome. They are glowing rings of stone pillars surrounding a mysterious altar. They are vital to getting to The Betweenlands.

Composition
-------------

Druid Circles consist of:

* Rune Stone, in pillars surrounding the altar
* Vines, on the pillars
* Dark Druid Altar, in the center of the circle
* Monster Spawner, under the altar

Assembling the Talisman
-------------------------

Druid Circles are the source of the Swamp Talisman that is needed to create a Portal Tree to the Betweenlands. Players will need to fight the Dark Druids that spawn around the structure for Swamp Talisman Pieces. Once four different talisman pieces have been obtained, they can be assembled at the Altar in the center of the structure to form the complete Swamp Talisman. See the Dark Druid Altar page for more details.

Mobs
------

The Monster Spawner underneath the Dark Druid Altar in a Druid Circle spawns Dark Druids. Destroying this spawner will stop further druids from spawning, but it can be recreated by putting four Saplings into the altar, in case more druids are needed for talisman pieces.

Configuration
---------------

The frequency at which Druid Circles spawn can be edited in the config.
