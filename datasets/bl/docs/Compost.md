### Composting
Compost can be created by composting various plant-based items in a Compost Bin, giving various amounts of Compost depending on the types of items used. For the items that can be used to make Compost, see Compost Times & Amounts.

#### Compost Times & Amounts
The following is a list of all blocks and items that can be turned into Compost, the amount of time they take to compost, and the compost amount value they add to the Compost Bin. One Compost item is produced per every 25 amount value "range" reached by the total items inside the bin. This means having a total value between 1 and 25 will produce one Compost, between 26 and 50 will produce two Compost, and so on.

One Compost Bin can hold a maximum of 20 items at a time, but will also stop accepting items if the total amount value of the items inside reaches or exceeds 400.

Properties
------------

### Farming
Compost can be right-clicked on Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass to fill the hole in the block with Compost. This then allows seeds to be planted on the block, namely White Pear Seeds, Spores, or Aspectrus Seeds. However, after three mature crop harvests from the block, the Compost inside will be consumed.

### Feeding
Compost can be right-clicked on a friendly Small Spirit Tree Face to feed it, healing it by 2 health () and occasionally causing it to produce 1-3 Sap Spit.
