Obtaining

### Crafting Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Octine Arrow** (4) | Octine Ingot + Weedwood Stick + Dragonfly Wing |  |

### Loot
Octine Arrows can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underground Ruins, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Urns of Chance in Sludge Plains Ruins and the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Dungeon Alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues and Shrines.

Properties
------------

### Shooting
Like vanilla Arrows, Octine Arrows can be shot from any Bow, including a Weedwood Bow or Predator Bow. The velocity they are shot at depends on how far back the bow is pulled, as well as how corroded it is. The arrows deal damage based on their velocity to whatever entity they hit. If they do not hit an entity, they will instead stick into the block they land on and can then be picked up, but will eventually despawn if left untouched.

Additionally, shot Octine Arrows set entities they hit on fire for 5 seconds. If the entity was already on fire, it will burn for 9 more seconds instead. Octine Arrows can also create fire from a distance - if they land on placed Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, or Thorns, they will destroy the plant and turn it into a fire block. This is one of the only ways to make fire in The Betweenlands.

Shot Octine Arrows emit a faint orange shader glow which remains when they stick into a block, illuminating the surrounding area slightly.

Uses
------

### Lightning Effects
If Betweenlands Lightning strikes one or more dropped Octine Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.
