Growing
---------

Planted Sap Tree Saplings will eventually grow into Sap Trees. Their growth can be expedited with Ground Dried Swamp Reed. They require a 13-by-13 space that is 17 blocks high in order to grow.

Compostability
----------------

Sap Tree Saplings have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 15. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Reactivating the Druid Spawner
--------------------------------

Like with most Saplings, Sap Tree Saplings can be used to recreate the Monster Spawner of the Druid Circle that was spawning Dark Druids before the Swamp Talisman was assembled, in case the player wants to fight the Druids again for more Talisman Pieces. This can be done in the Dark Druid Altar assembly interface.
