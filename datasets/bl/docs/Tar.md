Physics
---------

Tar flows at a slower speed than most other liquids, although not as slowly as vanilla Lava, and has no current force. It significantly slows down most players and mobs swimming in it, and is easy to sink in as it is particularly difficult to swim up through. It is not capable of creating infinite source blocks.

Tar Beasts and Tar Minions are not slowed down by Tar.

Drowning
----------

Tar will begin drowning most players and mobs as soon as they are completely submerged in it, without providing a breath meter. It deals 2 damage () per drowning tick, and ticks at a faster rate than other liquids. While completely submerged and drowning in Tar, the player's vision is blinded by a tar overlay.

Tar Beasts and Tar Minions cannot be drowned by Tar.

Liquid Interactions
---------------------

Upon contacting Swamp Water or Stagnant Water, Tar will form Solid Tar. This will occur regardless of whether either liquid is a source block or flowing. The same interaction occurs between Tar and vanilla Water.

Tar Beasts
------------

In Swamplands and Sludge Plains biomes, sufficiently sized pools of Tar are capable of spawning Tar Beasts, at varying rates.

If a Wight contacts Tar, it will transform into a Tar Beast after a few seconds.

Collection
------------

Tar can be collected with a Weedwood or Syrmorite Bucket, but can also be collected with vanilla Buckets, among other forms of collection outside of the Betweenlands.
