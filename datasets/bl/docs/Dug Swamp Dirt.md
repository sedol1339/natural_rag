Obtaining
-----------

### Digging
Dug Swamp Dirt is created by right-clicking on the top of Swamp Dirt or Coarse Swamp Dirt with a Betweenlands Shovel.

Properties
------------

### Composting
Right-clicking on Dug Swamp Dirt with Compost will fill the hole in the dirt with compost, allowing crops to be planted on it and plants to grow on it.

### Plant Support
Dug Swamp Dirt supports the placement and growth of basic plants. In addition, it supports the spread of Swamp Grass, which will turn it into Dug Swamp Grass.

When composted, Dug Swamp Dirt supports the growth of White Pear Plants by planting White Pear Seeds, Yellow Dotted Fungus by planting Spores, and Aspectrus Plants by planting Aspectrus Seeds on a Rubber Tree Plank Fence on top of it.

Composted Dug Swamp Dirt also allows basic plants placed on it to grow to other plant-supporting blocks adjacent to the composted block.

Note that the compost inside the Dug Swamp Dirt will be depleted after enough crop or plant harvests from it.

### Decay
Dug Swamp Dirt that is not composted will eventually revert to regular Swamp Dirt if it is left unfilled.

Composted Dug Swamp Dirt has a random chance to become decayed. The decay will spread to other nearby non-purified composted blocks and halt the growth of any plants growing on them. Any mature crops growing on them will eventually decay as well, causing them to drop nothing but seeds.

Decay can be temporarily cured by right-clicking the affected Dug Swamp Dirt with Plant Tonic. One Plant Tonic is capable of curing a five-by-five area of composted blocks.

Drops
-------

Dug Swamp Dirt drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The block itself cannot be collected in Survival Mode.
