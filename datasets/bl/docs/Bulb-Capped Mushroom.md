Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Bulb-Capped Mushrooms generate in rough patches under Giant Bulb-Capped Mushrooms in Patchy Islands biomes.

They also generate in Underground Oases and the Wight Fortress.

### Drops
Bulb-Capped Mushrooms items can drop occasionally from breaking Bulb-Capped Mushroom Stalks and Bulb-Capped Mushroom Caps.

Properties
------------

### Growing
Bulb-Capped Mushrooms will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. The mushrooms themselves can be right-clicked with a Betweenlands Shovel to dig the block underneath it if applicable, and right-clicked with Compost to compost the dug block underneath. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

### Potting
Bulb-Capped Mushrooms can be right-clicked on Mud Brick Flower Pots to place them inside decoratively. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Drops
-------

When broken, Bulb-Capped Mushrooms drop a **Bulb-Capped Mushrooms** item. The blocks themselves cannot be collected.

Item Properties
-----------------

### Planting
Bulb-Capped Mushrooms items can be used to plant Bulb-Capped Mushrooms on solid blocks, as long as there is not another block directly above them.

### Consuming
When eaten, Bulb-Capped Mushrooms items restore 3 hunger and 1.8 saturation. They also grant the  Night Vision II effect and inflict the  Nausea II effect for 10 seconds each.

#### Food Sickness
Like most other foods, Bulb-Capped Mushrooms items have a food sickness value between 0 and 180, initially at 0, that increases by 5 points each time they are eaten in the Betweenlands. The food's sickness value is represented by three tooltips for each stage, stating "Tastes good" between 0 and 49 food sickness points, diminishing to "Tastes plain" between 50 and 109 points, and then to "Can't eat this anymore" between 110 and 180 points. At 110 food sickness points or above, Bulb-Capped Mushrooms items only restore 1 hunger () when eaten, a third of the original hunger value.

Food sickness can be counteracted by eating a different type of sickness-affected food that has less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is at or below 10 points) from every other food item. It can also be counteracted by eating Chiromaw Wings or drinking Witch Tea, which both reset all other food sickness values to 0 - though Chiromaw Wings will then become sickening to eat themselves.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.

Uses
------

### Compostability
Both the block and item forms of Bulb-Capped Mushrooms can be composted in a Compost Bin. They have a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost value of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
