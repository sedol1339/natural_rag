### Crafting Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Wind Chime** | Reed Rope (2) + Ancient Remnant (4) + Orange Dentrothyst Shard |  |

Properties
------------

### Placement
The Wind Chime can only be placed on the underside of blocks.

### Prediction
The Wind Chime can forecast Events 5 minutes ahead, chiming again at 2 and 1 minutes, in which case a unique chime jingle can be heard as well as seeing the model swaying in the wind. Following this, a sphere-shaped visual effect will emanate from the Wind Chime depicting the event forecasted. The chime sound that plays also contains a preview of the forecasted event's ambience.

Events triggered by commands do not trigger the forecasting animation, even after the Wind Chime has been placed. The chime can accurately predict events from anywhere in The Betweenlands, but cannot predict the Spook or Winter events as they are seasonal. It does not function in other dimensions.

#### Attunement
The Wind Chime can be shift right-clicked to cycle between forecasting all Events and attuning to a specific Event. Attuning adjusts the chime to forecast only the selected event, but up to 10 minutes ahead instead of 5.

#### Event Forecasts
The following content is a list of predictable Events and their forecast visuals:

| Event Forecasts | |
| --- | --- |
| **Event** | **Forecast Visual** |
| Auroras |  |
| Blood Sky |  |
| Dense Fog |  |
| Heavy Rain |  |
| Rift |  |
| Snowfall |  |
| Thunderstorm |  |

Uses
------

### Fuel
The Wind Chime can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per Wind Chime.
