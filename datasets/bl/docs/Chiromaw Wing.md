Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Chiromaw Wings can drop from untamed Chiromaws upon death.

Properties
------------

### Consuming & Food Sickness
When eaten, Chiromaw Wings restore nothing. However, they reset the food sickness value on all other applicable food items to 0, returning them to the "Tastes good" state and removing all diminished returns. They can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is full.

After first being eaten, Chiromaw Wings will instantly accrue 180 food sickness points and enter a "sickening" state. They will remain sickening and cease to reset food sickness again until the wing's own food sickness value goes down to less than 110 from eating other sickness-affected foods that have less than 110 food sickness points, each deducting 3 points (4 if the new food is below 10 points) from the wing. Attempting to eat a Chiromaw Wing again when it has 110 points or higher, or at any point outside of the Betweenlands dimension, will instead inflict the  Hunger III effect for 30 seconds.

Visit the Food Sickness page for more details on the food sickness mechanic.
