The **Ancient Greatsword** is a powerful and unique weapon that can be obtained in the Crypt treasure room at the end of the winding walkways and crypt tunnel in the Labyrinthine Vaults. It is one of the 3 legendary weapons that can be obtained in this dungeon, the others being the Ancient Battle Axe and the Predator Bow.

Attacking
-----------

The Ancient Greatsword functions similarly to a regular sword and has the same base damage as a Valonite Sword but a slightly lower attack speed and a much longer range. When the sword is in hand, use of the shield is disabled until the player switches to another item. The Swords Attack animation resembles that of the Ancient Battleaxe, however it can strike in a much quicker fashion compared to the Valonite Greataxe and Ancient Battle axe.

Repairing
-----------

A damaged sword can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Ancient Greatsword** | Damaged **Ancient Greatsword** + Sulfur (26-47) + Life Crystal (42-83% Charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Ancient Greatsword is obtained in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Like with all Betweenlands weapons, corrision decreases its damage output.

A corroded Ancient Greatsword can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes the corrosion from **Ancient Greatsword** | **Ancient Greatsword** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250mb) |  |

An Ancient Greatsword can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keeps the corrosion level static until the Scabyst coatings durability is depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coated **Ancient Greatsword** (75 points per Scabyst) | **Ancient Greatsword** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Last but not least, a corroded Ancient greatsword can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on an Ancient Greatsword that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Ancient Greatsword** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Ancient Greatsword** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Ancient Greatsword can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The bonuses provided can be seen on the correlating gem.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies Middle Gem to **Ancient Greatsword** | **Ancient Greatsword** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Advancements
