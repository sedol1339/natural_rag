Growing
---------

Planted Nibbletwig Saplings will eventually grow into Nibbletwig Trees. Their growth can be expedited with Ground Dried Swamp Reed. They require a 5-by-5 space that is 7 blocks high in order to grow, but can reach a maximum height of 15 blocks.

Compostability
----------------

Nibbletwig Saplings have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 15. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Reactivating the Druid Spawner
--------------------------------

Like with most Saplings, Nibbletwig Saplings can be used to recreate the Monster Spawner of the Druid Circle that was spawning Dark Druids before the Swamp Talisman was assembled, in case the player wants to fight the Druids again for more Talisman Pieces. This can be done in the Dark Druid Altar assembly interface.
