Properties
------------

### Composting
The Compost Bin can be opened and closed with left-click. While open, it can be right-clicked with compostable items to put them inside. The number of items that can be put in is limited depending on their compost value, although the items do not all have to be the same. Attempting to put a non-compostable item in the Bin will display the message, "This item is not compostable". When the Bin is full, it will not accept any more items, and display the message, "The compost bin is full."

Once the lid is closed, the items inside will begin composting, indicated by the green particles emitting from the Bin. Items take a varying amount of time to compost depending on the item, and if there are multiple items inside with different time values, they will finish independently of each other. Each item will also yield a different amount of Compost depending on the item, so the amount of compost collected depends on the items composted.

When the bin is finished composting, the items will convert to a layer of compost that can now be collected. To do so, open the Bin again and right-click with a non-compostable item (or empty hand) to collect one Compost item at a time.

If the Compost Bin is destroyed while composting, items that have not finished will be recovered, but any finished compost will be lost.

### Compost Times & Amounts
The following is a list of all compostable blocks and items, the amount of time they take to compost, and the compost value they add to the Bin. One Compost item is produced every 25 value points. This means having a total value between 1 and 25 will produce one Compost, between 26 and 50 will produce two Compost, and so on.

One Compost Bin can hold a maximum of 20 items at a time, but will also stop accepting items if the total compost value of the items inside reaches or exceeds 400.
