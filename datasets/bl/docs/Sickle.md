Crafting Recipe

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sickle** | Valonite Shard (3) + Weedwood Stick + Reed Rope |  |

Harvesting Plants
-------------------

When the Sickle is used instead of something else to break a plant in the Betweenlands, the plant will drop its corresponding Plant Item. This item can then be ground into its corresponding Ground Item, which can then be used to make Infusions or can be separated into Aspect Vials.

The Sickle affects the following plants, fungi, and coral when used to mine them:

* Algae, Arrow Arum
* Bladderwort (flower and stalk separately), Blue Eyed Grass, Blue Iris, Bog Bean (flower or stalk), Boneset, Bottlebrush Grass, Broomsedge, Button Bush
* Cardinal Flower, Cattail, Cave Grass, Cave Moss, Copper Iris, Cryptweed
* Dead Weedwood Bush, Deep Water Coral, Double Swamp Tallgrass
* Edge Leaf, Edge Moss, Edge Shrooms
* Fallen Leaves
* Golden Club (flower or stalk)
* Hanger
* Lichen
* Marsh Hibiscus, Marsh Mallow, Marsh Marigold (flower or stalk), Milkweed, Mire Coral, Moss
* Nettle
* Pale Grass, Phragmites, Pickerel Weed, Pitcher Plant, Poison Ivy
* Rotbulb
* Shoots, Sludgecreep, Soft Rush, String Roots, Sundew, Swamp Plant, Swamp Tallgrass
* Tall Cattail, Tall Sludgecreep, Thorns
* Venus Fly Trap, Volarpad
* Water Weeds, Weedwood Bush

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Sickle can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Sickle** | Damaged **Sickle** + Sulfur (7-16) + Life Crystal (11-25% charge) |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Sickle is made in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases the chance for a plant item to be obtained from mining a plant.

A corroded Sickle can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Sickle** | Corroded and uncoated **Sickle** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Sickle can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Sickle** (75 points per piece) | **Sickle** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Sickle can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Sickle that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Sickle** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Sickle** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

The Sickle cannot be applied with Middle Gems.
