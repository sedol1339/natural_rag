  - There are 8 varieties (Cryptweed, Edge Leaf, Edge Moss, Edge Shrooms, Pale Grass,
    Rotbulb, String Roots, and Tall Sludgecreep), each can be ground and composted
    into ground items that contain Aspects. However, aspects are randomized at the
    world generation, and should be discovered through a Gecko testing. So, it is
    not possible to say in advance which of the Sludgeon plants contains more beneficial
    Aspects. However, Ground Pale Grass is the only Sludgeon plant with Aspect Tier
    II, and Edge Leaves are the only Sludgeon plant that contains 4 aspects. So, these
    two have the highest probability to be beneficial.
