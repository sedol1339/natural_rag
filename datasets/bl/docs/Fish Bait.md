Usage
-------

Fish Bait has the traits sinking speed, dissolve time, range, and glowing. Higher sinking speeds causes it to sink faster, higher dissolve time increases the time it stays in the water, range increases the range in which Anadia are attracted, and glowing causes the bait to attract Lurkers and glow in a similar effect to Glowing.

These traits can be modified by crafting Fish Bait with other items listed below.
