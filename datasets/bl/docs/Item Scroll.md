Obtaining

### Crafting Recipe
Fabricated Scrolls can be crafted from Loot Scraps, the recycled remains of various rare Loot items.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fabricated Scroll** | Shapeless: Amate Paper + Loot Scraps (3) |  |

### Drops
Fabricated Scrolls can drop rarely from looting Greebling Corpses and Greebling Coracles.

### Loot
Normal Item Scrolls can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underwater Ruins, Underground Ruins, Tar Pool Dungeons, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Urns of Chance in Sludge Plains Ruins and the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Dungeon Alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues, Shrines, Cragrock Towers, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

Uses
------

### Animating Uses
When animated in an Animator, both Item Scrolls and Fabricated Scrolls will turn into a random item (or stack of items) from a selection, with better items having a rarer chance to be obtained.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Random Item (weights vary) | **Item Scroll** + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal fuel (16 charge) |  |
| Random Item (weights vary \* 3/5) | **Fabricated Scroll** + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal fuel (16 charge) |  |

Loot
------

The loot from animating Item Scrolls and Fabricated Scrolls is derived from two loot tables: scroll and fabricated\_scroll, respectively.

The following is a list of all of the items that can be obtained from Item Scrolls and Fabricated Scrolls, including their rolls, quantities, and weights.

### fabricated\_scroll
The loot from animating Fabricated Scrolls is mostly the same as a normal Item Scroll, except there is a chance that the animation attempt will "fail" and the scroll will simply return some of the Loot Scraps used to make it.

| Fabricated Scroll Random Items | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Random Item** | **Quantity** | **Weight** |
| 1 Roll: | | |
| ****Item Scroll** Loot** (see scroll) | 1 | 3/5 (60%) |
| **Loot Scraps** | 1-3 | 2/5 (40%) |
