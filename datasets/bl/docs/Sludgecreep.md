Collection
------------

Sludgecreep must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops Sludgecreep Leaves, which can then be ground into Ground Sludgecreep.

Growing
---------

Sludgecreep will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, its growth will halt if the composted block it is growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Sludgecreep can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. It can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Sludgecreep has a compost process time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds and a compost amount of 5. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
