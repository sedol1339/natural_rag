### Crafting Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anadia Remains** | Shapeless: Raw Anadia Meat (2) |  |

### Trimming
All Anadia Parts can be obtained from trimming any *non-rotten* Anadia item in the Trimming Table. In most cases, the types of parts that can be obtained from an Anadia depend on its head type and tail type traits. Anadia Remains can be obtained by trimming a rotten Anadia (replacing all other items that would have been obtained) or by choosing to recycle any remaining items from *any* Anadia, yielding as many remains as there are items remaining in total.

For more information on what Anadia traits result in what types of Anadia Parts, see the List section below.

### Water Filtering
Anadia Remains can be obtained from filtering Stagnant Water with a Mesh Strainer in the Water Filter.

### Drops
Anadia Remains and Bones can drop from looting Greebling Coracles.

### Loot
Anadia Bones can be found as Loot from Pots of Chance in Underwater Ruins.

Uses
------

### Baiting
All Anadia Parts (including Anadia Remains) can be right-clicked on an empty Crab Pot to place one inside as bait. A baited Crab Pot will attract nearby Silt Crabs and Bubbler Crabs, and will capture them if they crawl on top of it. The part inside will be consumed upon capture.

### Upgrading
All Anadia Parts *except* Anadia Remains can be used as upgrades for varying pieces of Amphibious Armor by shift right-clicking the armor piece and placing the item in one or more of its upgrade slots (up to 3 can be placed in each slot). The effect of the upgrade depends on the type of part used:

* Each slot in the Amphibious Chestplate or Amphibious Leggings with an Anadia Swim Bladder upgrade causes the *full* armor set to provide increased *vertical* underwater movement speed (while holding the jump or sneak keys to go up or down respectively) when equipped. The speed bonus increases by 0.01 per used slot, and is cut in half while moving forward horizontally. Using at least one slot provides an additional speed increase of 0.02 while going up, which does not stack.
* Having a slot in the Amphibious Helmet with an Anadia Eye upgrade causes the armor piece to provide  Night Vision indefinitely while underwater when equipped.
* Having a slot in the Amphibious Helmet or Amphibious Chestplate with an Anadia Gills upgrade causes the armor piece to provide  Water Breathing indefinitely while underwater when equipped. The strength of the effect varies - normally, each slot used in a *single* armor piece simply decreases the rate at which breath goes down when equipped, but when wearing the full armor set, using 2 or more slots in the *same* armor piece completely prevents breath from going down.
* Each slot in any piece of Amphibious Armor with an Anadia Scales upgrade increases the armor attribute value provided by the armor piece by 0.5 (half of ) when equipped.
* Each slot in any piece of Amphibious Armor with an Anadia Bones upgrade increases the armor *toughness* attribute value provided by the armor piece by 0.5 when equipped.
* Each slot in the Amphibious Chestplate, Amphibious Leggings, or Amphibious Boots with an Anadia Fins upgrade causes the armor piece to provide a stacking (horizontal movement) speed attribute value of 0.01 when equipped. The stacking effect caps at a maximum of 4 used slots in the *same* armor piece - additional used slots will not provide any benefits. Having 4 or more used slots *total* also prevents the player from getting stuck in Mud.

Each Anadia Part item at the top of an upgrade stack will receive durability damage when the armor itself is damaged, and will retain this durability loss even if taken out of the armor, becoming unstackable with other Anadia Part items even of the same type. Each item has a maximum durability of 64 before breaking, and the armor will then start using the next item down if it was stacked.

### Fuel
Anadia Remains can be used as fuel for the Crab Pot Filter, filtering 4 items per piece.
