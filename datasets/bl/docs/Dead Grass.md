Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Dead Grass generates in large quantities on the surface of Swamplands biomes, and can be obtained by breaking Swamp Grass with a Sickle.

Properties
------------

### Plant Support
Dead Grass supports the placement and growth of basic plants.

### Growth & Death
Unlike regular Swamp Grass, Dead Grass does not grow to nearby Swamp Dirt. However, it will eventually become Swamp Dirt if a solid block is placed directly on top of it.

### Events
Placed Dead Grass will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.

Drops
-------

Dead Grass drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The block itself must be broken with a Silk Touch tool to be collected.
