Description
-------------

Living Roots are sentient roots that protrude from holes in the Labyrinthine Vaults. They feel around their environment with tentacle-like movements, and when encountering a player they will reach towards them to attack.

Like Worm Holes and Lampreys, if their target moves out of their line of sight Living Roots will relocate themselves, gradually shrinking until they disappear into their holes and then sealing them off, then opening a new hole closer to their target's location. Also like these two mobs, the amount of health a Living Root has is indicated by how damaged its hole appears - the more cracked it appears, the less health the mob has.

Their "body", like all variants of Sludge Worms, can vary and shift, and with more damage dealt, there is the unique effect of the root flying backwards from recoil with enough damage applied - sometimes making them spin as they point upwards while on a wall.

Strategy
----------

There is no exact strategy to fight these tendrils, though they can be tedious, with how far from their hole they can reach. To note, one can effectively harm one at any part of the root - even if one were to slice at the end, the entire root will take damage. This applies to the root itself, even though it tries to do damage with the tip alone (without any clear visual for damage, considering how slow it moves).

Due to its color and pattern matching Rotten Bark, fighting it in the darkness without Night Vision or any form of light is ill-advised, as they would be harder to see (and therefore, make it seem like you are being attacked by other enemies).

Drops
-------

The drops from Living Roots are derived from the wall\_living\_root loot table. However, this contains no content by default.
