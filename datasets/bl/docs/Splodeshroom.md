Description
-------------

Splodeshrooms are magenta, semi-opaque mushrooms that explode into a gas cloud when destroyed, or when a player is close.

Behavior
----------

Approaching within three blocks of a Splodeshroom will cause it to start rapidly shaking and inflate, before suddenly exploding into a small cloud of noxious fumes. The player will be inflicted with the  Elixir of Decay and  Blindness effects for as long as they stand within the cloud. This exploding behavior can be bypassed entirely by sneaking when near the Splodeshroom, even if it is at a state where it is ready to burst, if not already charging to do so. Getting up at this point will make it explode, if it is still shaking and inflated.

How a Splodeshroom applies these effects via its fumes is not exactly by its growing (and later fading) fumes, but more like a block that starts large, and shrinks away. This "effect" is always half a block tall, shrinking at its edges gradually. Even with this knowledge, though, one is still advised to wait for a Splodeshroom's fumes to vanish, first, even if roots attack.
