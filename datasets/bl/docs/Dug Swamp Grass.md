Obtaining
-----------

### Digging
Dug Swamp Grass is created by right-clicking on the top of Swamp Grass with a Betweenlands Shovel.

### Spread
Dug Swamp Grass is created when Swamp Grass or Dug Purified Swamp Grass spreads to Dug Swamp Dirt.

Properties
------------

### Coloration
Dug Swamp Grass takes on different grass colors depending on what biome it is in. The grass color is:

* #7CBD6B if in the inventory
* #6BC44E in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #627017 in Marsh biomes
* #1FC66D to  #1FC63D in Patchy Islands biomes
* #5B3522 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #2AFF00 to  #50A040 in Swamplands biomes

### Composting
Right-clicking on Dug Swamp Grass with Compost will fill the hole in the grass with compost, allowing crops to be planted on it and plants to grow on it.

### Plant Support
Dug Swamp Grass supports the placement and growth of basic plants.

When composted, Dug Swamp Grass supports the growth of White Pear Plants by planting White Pear Seeds, Yellow Dotted Fungus by planting Spores, and Aspectrus Plants by planting Aspectrus Seeds on a Rubber Tree Plank Fence on top of it.

Composted Dug Swamp Grass also allows basic plants placed on it to grow to other plant-supporting blocks adjacent to the composted block.

Note that the compost inside the Dug Swamp Grass will be depleted after enough crop or plant harvests from it.

### Decay
Dug Swamp Grass that is not composted will eventually revert to regular Swamp Grass if it is left unfilled.

Composted Dug Swamp Grass has a random chance to become decayed. The decay will spread to other nearby non-purified composted blocks and halt the growth of any plants growing on them. Any mature crops growing on them will eventually decay as well, causing them to drop nothing but seeds.

Decay can be temporarily cured by right-clicking the affected Dug Swamp Grass with Plant Tonic. One Plant Tonic is capable of curing a 5x5 area of composted blocks.

### Spreading & Death
Dug Swamp Grass will spread to nearby Dug Swamp Dirt over time. It can also spread to Swamp Dirt and Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, turning them into Swamp Grass and Dug Purified Swamp Grass respectively.

Dug Swamp Grass will eventually become Dug Swamp Dirt if a solid block is placed directly on top of it.

Drops
-------

Dug Swamp Grass drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The block itself cannot be collected in Survival Mode.
