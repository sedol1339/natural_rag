Flowering
-----------

Venus Fly Traps naturally go through cycles of flowering, blooming their flowers over time and eventually wilting back to their normal state.

Collection
------------

Venus Fly Traps must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Venus Fly Trap Head, which can then be ground into Ground Venus Fly Trap.

Growing
---------

Venus Fly Traps will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Venus Fly Traps can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Venus Fly Traps have a compost process time of 8 minutes and 20 seconds and a compost amount of 12. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
