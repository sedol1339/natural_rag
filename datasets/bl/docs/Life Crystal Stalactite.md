Obtaining

### Generation
Life Crystal Stalactites generate in formations deep underwater in Lake Caverns between Y-layers 15 and 0. Life Crystal Ore has a small chance to generate in place of any normal Life Crystal Stalactite block in a formation.

Properties
------------

### Placement
Life Crystal Stalactites and Ore can only be placed underwater. They connect vertically with each other, forming elongated stalactite or stalagmite formations that grow smaller the further they are to the tip.

### Detection
Life Crystal Ore can be detected through blocks by using a Gem Singer.

Drops
-------

Life Crystal Stalactites drop nothing when broken. However, Life Crystal Ore will drop a Life Crystal with 100% charge when broken. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in Survival Mode.
