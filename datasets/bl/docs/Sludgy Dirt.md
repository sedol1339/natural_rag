Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Normal Sludgy Dirt generates in relatively large patches on the surface of Sludge Plains biomes and the Sludge Plains Clearing sub-biome.

### Post-Generation
Spreading Sludgy Dirt generates from killed, naturally generating Spirit Trees.

Properties
------------

### Plant Support
Sludgy Dirt supports the placement and growth of basic plants.

### Movement
Sludgy Dirt slows down the movement of players and non-Betweenlands mobs greatly when walked over, and prevents them from jumping as well. Unlike most other slowing blocks, there is no way to negate this slowing effect, not even with Rubber Boots.

Betweenlands mobs are not slowed by Sludgy Dirt.

### Spreading
If the Large Spirit Tree Face of a naturally generated Spirit Tree is killed, the tree will begin to die. The surrounding Swamp Grass of the tree will slowly convert into Spreading Sludgy Dirt, which acts the same as regular Sludgy Dirt but spreads to the rest of the Swamplands Clearing sub-biome that the tree generates in. This essentially turns the biome into a miniature Sludge Plains biome, capable of spawning Sludges and Smol Sludges.

### Events
Placed Sludgy Dirt will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.

Drops
-------

Sludgy Dirt drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The blocks themselves must be broken with a Silk Touch tool to be collected.
