Particles

Water Weeds must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drops a Water Weeds (item), which can then be ground into Ground Water Weeds.

Growing

Water Weeds will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when underwater and on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
