Obtaining
-----------

### Smelting Recipe
| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dead Moss** + 0.1 XP | **Moss** + Any fuel |  |

### Generation
Normal Moss generates in patches in Swamplands and Patchy Islands biomes and the Swamplands Clearing sub-biome, as well as underground in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers. It also generates on natural Giant Roots and Idol Head Statues.

Properties
------------

### Coloration
Moss takes on different foliage colors depending on what biome it is in. The foliage color is:

* #48B518 if in the inventory
* #A8A800 to  #A87800 in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #63B581 in Marsh biomes
* #00AD7C in Patchy Islands biomes
* #D36423 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #52AF5A to  #85AF51 in Swamplands biomes
* #52AF5A in Swamplands Clearing biomes

### Growth and Decay
Regular Moss naturally goes through cycles of growth, spreading to nearby blocks slowly over time and eventually dying out.

Dead Moss does not grow.

### Igniting
Moss can be used to create fire by holding right-click on either its placed or dropped form with an Octine Ingot. Moss that is adjacent to or on a Block of Octine will also catch fire, although this fire will not spread to further Moss blocks.

### Events
Placed Moss will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events, which are not affected by biome foliage colors.

Drops
-------

Moss drops nothing when broken. The block itself must be broken with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When broken with a Sickle, it instead drops a Moss (item).

Uses
------

### Compostability
Regular Moss has a compost process time of 7 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Dead Moss has a compost process time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
