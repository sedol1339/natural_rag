### Lightning Effects
If Betweenlands Lightning strikes one or more dropped Angler Tooth Arrow, Poisoned Angler Tooth Arrow, Octine Arrow, Basilisk Arrow, or Sludge Worm Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.

### Loot
Shock Arrows can be found as Loot from:

* Pots of Chance in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers, Marsh Ruins, Underground Ruins, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress.
* Urns of Chance in Sludge Plains Ruins and the Sludgeon Tower, Labyrinthine Vaults, Barrishee Lair, and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Dungeon Alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon.
* Weedwood Chests in Idol Head Statues, Shrines, the Wight Fortress, and the Labyrinthine Vaults and Barrishee Lair of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Shooting
Like vanilla Arrows, Shock Arrows can be shot from any Bow, including a Weedwood Bow or Predator Bow. The velocity they are shot at depends on how far back the bow is pulled, as well as how corroded it is. The arrows deal damage based on their velocity to whatever entity they hit. If they do not hit an entity, they will instead stick into the block they land on and can then be picked up, but will eventually despawn if left untouched.

Additionally, shot Shock Arrows emit a burst of electricity upon hitting an entity if there is one or more other entities nearby, chaining a bolt towards each of them and damaging them as well. The shock can spread by traveling through multiple entities in a chain up to a varying limit, even through blocks, damaging each of them (including any entities mounted on top of them). Under normal circumstances, any entity within a 9x9x9 area centered on any entity that is struck by the arrow or its shock is within range to be shocked (as long as it was not already struck by the same burst before), and each bolt can chain through 2-4 entities.
