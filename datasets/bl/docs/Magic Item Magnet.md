Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magic Item Magnet** (10 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (13% charge) |  |

How to Equip
--------------

The Magic Item Magnet can be right-clicked to equip it onto the player in an invisible slot beside the hotbar. Note that only one magnet can be equipped at a time.

The Magic Item Magnet is equipped through the Radial Equipment Menu, which is opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any magnet equipped onto the player (in red tab) as well as magnets in their inventory (in green tab). A magnet can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management of magnet equipping.

Effect
--------

When equipped, the Magic Item Magnet will slowly levitate items in about a 7-block radius around the player towards them. Blue particles will emanate from affected items and they will swirl around the player until they are picked up. This allows players to pick up items from farther away or from areas they cannot normally reach.

Note that the Magic Item Magnet will take durability damage every time it is used to pick up an item.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Magic Item Magnet can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
