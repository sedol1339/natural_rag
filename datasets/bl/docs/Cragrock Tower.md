*"There was this massive tower that I found, and as foreboding as it looked, I figured it could be a place to settle down for a while to figure out what to do. Not a chance. The ghosts were in tremendous numbers."*

> *-From Explorer's Entries: The Tower*

**Cragrock Towers** are large, extremely tall dungeon-like structures that generate uncommonly in Coarse Islands and Raised Isles biomes. These structures contain large amounts of loot, including some high-end items, but are very dangerous. Precaution and preparation before attempting to conquer them is absolutely necessary.

Cragrock Towers have a world location that identifies the area they take up, as well as a title that appears briefly to players who approach one.

Most of the blocks of a Cragrock Tower are protected from destruction by a ward that persists until the tower is fully completed and has crumbled. Additionally, attempting to scale the Tower without completing each room first will teleport the player back to the base of the tower and inflict them with Blindness III () for 3 seconds.

Navigation

The staircase

The first floor, with the Termite spawner

The second floor

The third floor

The fourth floor, with the Chiromaw spawner

The sixth floor, with the Pyrad spawner

The top of the tower

### Staircase
A large staircase at the bottom of a Cragrock Tower leads to its entrance. The Wisps dotting the pillars along this staircase are not visible until the player approaches the Tower, when they individually light up one by one up the staircase. This rule for the Wisps is not affected by the Auroras event.

### First to Third Floors
The player will enter the Cragrock Tower on the second floor, with a first and third floor available to them. The first floor contains a Monster Spawner that spawns Termites. Destroying this spawner and all of the mobs that spawned from it will remove the blocks preventing further passage on the third floor, allowing access to the fourth.

### Fourth to Seventh Floors
From here on, a similar rule follows: The fourth floor blocks passage to the fifth until the Monster Spawner in its room is destroyed and all of the mobs that spawned from it are killed, the same with the next floor, and so on. The mobs that come from the spawners will get progressively more difficult the further up the Tower the player gets.

### Top Floor
Once passage beyond the seventh floor is cleared, the player will have access to the very top of the Tower, which has 2 spawners to be dealt with, and up to 3 Weedwood Chests containing the best loot in the Tower. These chests each have a 50% chance of generating. Once the top spawners and mobs are destroyed, the Tower will be officially "completed," and all players involved will receive 350 experience as a reward.

To signify completion, all of the Glowing Smooth Cragrock in the Tower will light up, and the Tower's icon on an Amate Map will be accompanied by a check mark.

Crumbling
-----------

Once a Cragrock Tower has been completed and all players have left the top floor, the screen will start shaking and the tower will start "crumbling." The blocks of each floor will start to fall, which can cause damage if they fall on the player. The shaking and block falling will get progressively more severe the further down the Tower the player goes, and the original entrance of the Tower will be temporarily blocked off. The shaking will continue as long as the player is in the tower while it crumbles. The crumbling will persist for about a minute, then the entrance will open up again. It is at this point that the ward protecting the blocks of the Tower disappears.

Mobs
------

The Monster Spawner on the first floor of a Cragrock Tower always spawns Termites. The spawner on the fourth floor always spawns Chiromaws, the fifth one Swamp Hags, the sixth Pyrads, and the seventh Wights. The spawners at the very top spawn both Swamp Hags and Wights.

Loot
------

Cragrock Tower Pots use cragrock\_tower\_pot as their loot table, and Chests use cragrock\_tower\_chest.
