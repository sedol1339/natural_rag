# Lake Cavern

[Aside block] Lake Cavern
-------------------------

### Type

Natural

### Generation

Anywhere between the Cavern layer and bedrock

### Water Color

#131844 (fades in from the surface down to Y=15)

A huge Lake Cavern with Underground Ruins

A lake formed as part of the Caverns, with swimming Anglers

The **Lake Cavern** layer of the Betweenlands begins just below the normal Cavern layer, at a Y-layer of 45, and continues down until it touches Bedrock, at Y=0.

Caves and ravines continue to generate down here, but they are completely flooded from Y=15 downwards, forming underground lakes. The same underground ambient tracks play here as in the normal Cavern layer, and there is less fog.
