Crypt Crawlers
----------------

Crypt Crawler chiefs spawn equipped with a Syrmorite Shield. The shield has a chance to drop when the Crypt Crawler chief is killed.

Blocking
----------

Like any shield, the Syrmorite Shield can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player receives a small amount of knockback upon blocking. The shield can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

The Syrmorite Shield grants the player the unique ability to charge into their enemies by holding down shift while blocking with it, then letting go of shift. The player will speed forward, dealing damage to any mobs that they contact from the front and knocking them back greatly. The longer the shield is charged before releasing, the further the player will charge before stopping, up to a maximum of 4 seconds. Note that doing this causes the player to consume hunger at a much faster than usual rate.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Syrmorite Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Syrmorite Shield** | Damaged **Syrmorite Shield** + Sulfur (6-12) + Life Crystal (6-25% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Syrmorite Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
