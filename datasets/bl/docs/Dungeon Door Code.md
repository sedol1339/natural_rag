A Dungeon Door Code ingame

**Dungeon Door Codes** are special puzzle blocks that are found in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon. They display the rune combinations that are used to open Dungeon Doors.

Combination
-------------

Next to the stairs leading down to each layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults is a Dungeon Door Code containing a randomly generated rune combination on its face. This combination consists of three pieces that form a rune when put together. The player must memorize the combination on the code, reach a Dungeon Door on the same layer of the vaults as that code, and shift the rune appearance on its center piece to match the code combination in order to open the door. Note that a Rune Door Key can be used to immediately open a Dungeon Door without having to use this code.

In Creative Mode, the player can right-click the top, middle, or bottom of a Dungeon Door Code's face to shift the rune combination appearance on that section to the next one. However, this does not change the combination that is required to open a Dungeon Door. Player-placed codes also have no effect on dungeon door combinations.

Dungeon Runes
---------------

The following is a list of all rune pieces that form the combinations generated on Dungeon Door Codes. Each section of the rune has 8 possible appearances, meaning there are 512 possible rune combinations.

| Dungeon Rune Pieces | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Top Section** | **Middle Section** | **Bottom Section** |
| Top 1 | Middle 1 | Bottom 1 |
| Top 2 | Middle 2 | Bottom 2 |
| Top 3 | Middle 3 | Bottom 3 |
| Top 4 | Middle 4 | Bottom 4 |
| Top 5 | Middle 5 | Bottom 5 |
| Top 6 | Middle 6 | Bottom 6 |
| Top 7 | Middle 7 | Bottom 7 |
| Top 8 | Middle 8 | Bottom 8 |

Collection
------------

Dungeon Door Codes drop nothing when harvested. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in any way.
