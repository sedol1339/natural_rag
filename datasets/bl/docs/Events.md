# Events

**Events** are random occurrences within the Betweenlands that last for a limited period of time, often affecting one or more aspects of the dimension. Events are mostly weather related, but also include additional, more supernatural events. Many events can also stack on top of each other and occur at the same time.

The Spook, Winter and Snowfall events are also date-specific holiday events, meaning they will only happen around Halloween and Christmas respectively.

Events can be manually toggled with the following command: /blevent <toggle/on/off> thebetweenlands:<event name>. Event names are the same as those listed on this wiki, but with underscores instead of spaces. (E.G. Heavy rain is thebetweenlands:heavy\_rain)

* Auroras: Streaks of light appear floating in the sky. Wisps will not disappear and can be collected.
* Blood Sky: The sky turns deep red and spooky noises play. Enemies are much more dangerous and spawn in increased amounts.
* Dense Fog: A thick fog that obstructs visibility. Ghost-like silhouettes stalk the player the longer the event progresses.
* Heavy Rain: Rain falls heavily and puddles cause flooding over solid ground, extinguishing torches and destroying uncovered crops.
* Rift: A crack opens in the sky, showing a glimpse of the overworld's sky and brightening up the dimension.
* Snowfall: A Winter sub-event causing snow to fall from the sky and pile up.
* Spook: A Halloween season exclusive event causing everything to look and sound spooky.
* Thunderstorm: A Heavy Rain sub-event causing lightning to strike randomly.
* Winter: A Christmas season exclusive event where textures chance to frosty variants and water begins to freeze.
