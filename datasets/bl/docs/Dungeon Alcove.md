Dungeon Alcoves with urns

**Dungeon Alcoves** are special blocks that can be found along walls in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon. They contain a varying assortment of decorative cobwebs and non-functional candles, and occasionally urns with loot.

Collecting Loot
-----------------

Urns that are in Dungeon Alcoves can be instantly broken by left-clicking the alcove containing them. Each urn will drop one or more items from a location-based loot table when broken. Be careful, as there is a chance that an alcove urn will also spawn an Ash Sprite when broken. The urns can also be broken off of alcoves by a screaming Barrishee, in which case the Ash Sprite will always spawn.

Loot
------

The loot in the Dungeon Alcove urns is derived from two loot tables:

* sludge\_worm\_dungeon\_urn is used by alcoves in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon.
* sludge\_worm\_dungeon\_crypt\_urn is used by alcoves in the Crypt of the Sludgeon.

Visit the Loot Tables page for the contents of these loot tables.

Collection
------------

Dungeon Alcoves without urns drop nothing when harvested. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in any way.
