Properties
------------

### Shooting
Like vanilla Arrows, Angler Tooth Arrows can be shot from any Bow, including a Weedwood Bow or Predator Bow. The velocity they are shot at depends on how far back the bow is pulled, as well as how corroded it is. The arrows deal damage based on their velocity to whatever entity they hit, with no extra effects by default. If they do not hit an entity, they will instead stick into the block they land on and can then be picked up, but will eventually despawn if left untouched.

Uses
------

### Lightning Effects
If Betweenlands Lightning strikes one or more dropped Angler Tooth Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.
