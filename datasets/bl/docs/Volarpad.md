Collection
------------

Volarpads must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Volarpad Leaf, which can then be ground into Ground Volarpad.

Growing
---------

Volarpads will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Volarpads have a compost process time of 9 minutes and 10 seconds and a compost amount of 15. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Volarpads will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event.
