Description
-------------

The Primordial Malevolence is disembodied head similar to Prime Wight's, only with an eye in place of the face, surrounded by an icosahedron-shaped, spinning shield of energy. It has a custom boss health bar and battle music.

At first, the Primordial Malevolence cannot be attacked, as it's protected by the blue-triangle shield segments surrounding it, which damage the player and knock them back if hit, flashing purple. In order to break a shield segment, the player has to "catch" the green projectiles it shoots, then throw them back at the Malevolence. This can be done by left-clicking on the projectile with a sword, then left-clicking again to throw them.

If it hits, one of the Malevolence's shields will break and it will temporarily lower to the ground, firing blue projectiles all around itself before rising up again. The Malevolence can only be damaged through the broken parts of its shield; the more shields that are broken, the easier it is to deal damage.

Upon death, the Primordial Malevolence will use a custom death animation, exploding into blue projectiles and spilling its drops and experience. Once the Malevolence is dead, the Wight Fortress will no longer have block protection over it, allowing you to place and break blocks in its world area.

### Attacks
During the fight, it will teleport above and around the player while using four different attacks:

* Summoning several "heads" around the player. They will hover for a moment before flying towards and damage the player. There are two different types of projectiles; green ones can be snagged by left clicking with a sword, and blue ones that cannot.
* Summoning a Wight. This Wight only has 30 (x15) health instead of the usual 76 (x38), but can still "possess" players normally. The Malevolence will not summon a new Wight if the previous one is still alive, and will teleport the summoned Wight back onto the platform should it be knocked off.
* Placing a blue energy field on the ground. This spinning blue energy triangle will damage any players that walk into it and heal the Malevolence as the player takes damage, lasting for a few seconds before disappearing. It can also be destroyed with the Shockwave Sword's shockwave attack.
* When at half health, it can summon "heads" in a circle around the player which quickly launch at them. The rate of "head" spawning increases over a period of 10 seconds until the attack finally ends with the spawning of "heads" in a 360-degree circle that all fly at the player's position in quick succession. All of these projectiles are blue, so they cannot be caught.

Strategy
----------

The Malevolence's attacks can usually be predicted and dodged accordingly, and fighting it is mostly a matter of keeping this up until the player can break enough of its shield to reliably do damage. As it can be a long fight, players should bring a bow and plenty of arrows due to its aerial movement style. As the Malevolence spends most of its time hovering above the arena one block out of reach, one can easily use a Ring of Ascent to simply hover over and hit it, or even jump and hit it in midair. Remember to also bring enough food to last the whole battle. The Shockwave Sword found in the same Wight Fortress can also be useful in dispelling the Malevolence's ground traps as well as attacking it when it lands, and a Wight's Bane can be useful against the Wights it summons. At half health, it will add a new attack to its arsenal (seen above), which can be dodged by running in circles around the arena.

The Malevolence is immune to knockback, a trait to keep in mind.

Should the player fall off the arena while fighting the Primordial Malevolence, it will begin to heal until the player rejoins the fight by staring into the "eye" portal again. Players should also consider bringing a Ring of Ascent or Water Bucket to break their fall should this happen, as the fall can easily kill the player otherwise.
