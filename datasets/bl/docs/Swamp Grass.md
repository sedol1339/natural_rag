Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Swamp Grass generates on the surface of Swamplands, Patchy Islands, Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Marsh biomes and the Swamplands Clearing sub-biome, as well as in Underground Oases.

Properties
------------

### Coloration
Placed Swamp Grass takes on different grass colors depending on what biome it is in. The grass color is:

* #7CBD6B if in the inventory
* #6BC44E in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #627017 in Marsh biomes
* #1FC66D to  #1FC63D in Patchy Islands biomes
* #5B3522 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #2AFF00 to  #50A040 in Swamplands biomes

### Plant Support
Swamp Grass supports the placement and growth of basic plants. In addition, right-clicking on Swamp Grass with Ground Dried Swamp Reed will randomly sprout several basic plants on it, including Swamp Tallgrass, Double Swamp Tallgrass, Cattails, Tall Cattails, and Shoots.

### Growth and Death
Swamp Grass will grow to nearby Swamp Dirt over time. It can also grow to Dug Swamp Dirt and Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, turning them into Dug Swamp Grass and Dug Purified Swamp Grass respectively.

Swamp Grass will eventually become Swamp Dirt if a solid block is placed directly on top of it.

### Digging
Right-clicking on the top of Swamp Grass with a Shovel from the Betweenlands will turn it into Dug Swamp Grass, which can then be used in Farming. Note that the block will revert back to regular Swamp Grass if it is left unfilled.

### Events
Placed Swamp Grass will take on an alternative texture during the Winter seasonal event, which is not affected by biome foliage colors.

Drops
-------

Swamp Grass drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The block itself must be broken with a Silky Pebble explosion or a Silk Touch tool to be collected. When broken with a Sickle, Swamp Grass will drop Dead Grass.
