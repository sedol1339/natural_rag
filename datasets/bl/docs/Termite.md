**Termites** are insect mobs that can spawn occasionally when a player breaks Rotten Weedwood Bark, a Pot or Urn of Chance, as well as from some Monster Spawners in Shrines, Cragrock Towers and the Wight Fortress.

A Termite, as seen in-game.

Description
-------------

Termites appear as insects with white, curved abdomens and orange mandibles. They are normally larger than vanilla Silverfish, but smaller ones can be found in Pots of Chance.

They emit a constant chattering sound, and crawl around quickly to melee-attack players.

Termites can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

Strategy
----------

Termites are similar to vanilla Silverfish; individually they are easy to kill, but can be overwhelming in swarms. Thankfully they can be avoided in most cases simply by not breaking too many Pots of Chance or Rotten Bark blocks at once, and Spawners can be quickly broken or avoided entirely.

If spawned from a broken block, Termites may also take a short amount of time before they notice the player and begin attacking. This can prove the best time to strike, as moving Termites can be harder to hit.

Drops
-------

The drops from Termites are derived from the termite loot table.

The following is a list of all of the items that can be dropped by Termites, including their rolls, quantities, and weights.
