Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Polished Limestone Spike Traps generate in the Armory of the Wight Fortress.

Mud Brick and Mud Tiles Spike Traps generate in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Pit of Decay of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Trapping
Spike Traps randomly switch between an active and inactive state, indicated by the holes in their texture opening and closing. The spike side can be oriented upwards or sideways, but not downwards.

If a player stands in front of the holes while the block is active, spikes will protrude from the holes. These spikes will deal 2 () damage before retracting, extending again if the player hasn't moved. In addition, if a block is placed directly over or one block away from the spikes, even if the trap is inactive, the spikes will protrude and instantly destroy the block, dropping it as an item if it can be dropped.

Spike Traps only trigger for players and non-Betweenlands mobs, and will not damage Betweenlands mobs even if the spikes are triggered by something else.

Drops
-------

When broken, Spike Traps drop nothing. The blocks themselves cannot be collected in Survival Mode.

Sounds
--------
