Tower Completion
------------------

Each floor of the Cragrock Tower contains one block of Glowing Smooth Cragrock, initially in an "Inactive" state that does not produce light. Once all of the Monster Spawners in the tower have been destroyed and all mobs spawned from them have been killed, every Glowing Smooth Cragrock block in the tower will light up and become active, signifying that the tower has been completely conquered.

Trivia
