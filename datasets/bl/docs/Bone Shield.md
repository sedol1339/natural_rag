Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bone Shield** | Slimy Bone (6) + Reed Rope |  |

Crypt Crawlers
----------------

Some Crypt Crawlers can spawn equipped with a Bone Shield. The shield has a chance to drop when the Crypt Crawler is killed.

Blocking
----------

Like any shield, the Bone Shield can be held up to block melee and ranged attacks from the front. The player receives a small amount of knockback upon blocking. The shield can be temporarily disabled by an axe attack. If the player is inflicted with Slugarm Brew, then attacks will not be blocked.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, a damaged Bone Shield can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs **Bone Shield** | Damaged **Bone Shield** + Sulfur (4-8) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Bone Shield can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Bone Shield** | **Bone Shield** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Corrosion
-----------

The Bone Shield does not corrode.
