Description
-------------

Blood Snails appear as snails with red striped shells. They move slowly, often staying in place when no player is nearby. When they spot a player, they'll chase them down in an attempt to inflict melee damage. If the player gets further than 5 blocks from the Snail, they'll begin to spit arcing 'jets of blood' at them as they chase. If it hits, it can inflict Poison I () for 5 seconds.

Blood Snails only attack players, Tarminions and Emberlings, although their blood jet attack can hit other mobs on accident.

Blood Snails can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

Strategy
----------

Blood Snails are fairly rare mobs, but can be a threat when faced alongside other enemies. Their blood jet attacks can be difficult to dodge, but they won't shoot if the player stays close to them. They also have very low health, so simply rushing them may prove a good strategy.

They're also relatively slow, have a small detection radius, and don't wander nearly as much as other mobs, meaning in most cases they can simply be avoided.

-------
