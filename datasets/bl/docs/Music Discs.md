There are 15 **Music Discs** added to the Betweenlands mod. They are all treasure from animating Item Scrolls, and they can also be found as Loot from chests in Shrines, Cragrock Towers, and the Wight Fortress. The Frosty Disc can additionally be found as Loot from Presents during the Winter seasonal event. The only exception is Deep Water, which is obtained through other methods.
