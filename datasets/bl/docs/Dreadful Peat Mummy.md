*"Then take that mummy and make some impossible demon burst open and grow out of its back, and form four gigantic fleshy legs which it uses to drag around said mummy. Absolutely dreadful. No one should have to face such a thing."*

> *-From Mutants of Terror*

Description
-------------

The Dreadful Peat Mummy is a terrifying foe, being a regular Peat Mummy with partially severed limbs, a large tongue, no hair, and with fleshy legs sprouting out of its back which it uses to crawl around. It has a custom boss health bar and battle music.

During its boss fight it will deal basic melee damage as well as use three additional attacks against its adversaries:

* It will occasionally summon a normal Peat Mummy to aid itself in the fight, screaming in the process. The Peat Mummies it summons will only have 30 health (x15) as opposed to their natural counterpart, making them less difficult; however, they still deal the same damage and have the same attack.
* When attacking with melee damage, it has a chance to 'snatch' its target. It will carry and continually bite the it for a couple seconds before letting them go.
* It will shoot a sludge ball projectile. The sludge ball will bounce on surfaces until it hits its target, dealing damage as well as inflicting Slowness III () for 5 seconds.

When damaged, it takes no knockback.

Upon death, the Dreadful Peat Mummy will use a custom death animation, digging into the ground and leaving behind its drops as well as a lot of experience. However, it may take the player with it as it digs down, suffocating them.

The Dreadful Peat Mummy has a chance to spawn applied with a random Amulet, which will give it Middle Gem Circle benefits depending on the type applied. This amulet will not drop upon its death.

Strategy
----------

The **Dreadful Peat Mummy** can be very hard to fight, due to its large arsenal of attacks. It is an incredibly fast swimmer, can break blocks in order to close distance with its target, and can summon minions to fight for it. Any crowd control weapons, like the Shockwave Sword for example, are ideal in order to manage the fight with the Peat Mummies. The boss itself is vulnerable to the effect of Basilisk and Poisoned Arrows. Due to its strength, a good armor as well as Middle Gems will help withstand the damage dealt by the boss. When it is on low HP, the player should back off as to not get suffocated in it's death throes.
