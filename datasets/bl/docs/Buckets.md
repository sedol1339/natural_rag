Crafting Recipes

Liquid Collection
-------------------

Buckets are capable of collecting and placing Swamp Water, Stagnant Water, Tar, and Rubber liquids.

Infuser
---------

Empty Buckets can be used to collect raw infusions from the Infuser for Infusion Buckets.

Purifier
----------

Swamp Water Buckets can be used to fill the Purifier with water, which is required in order to purify items. One Purifier can be filled with up to sixteen Buckets worth of water, and consumes one Bucket worth per purified item.

Tapping
---------

An empty Bucket can also be utilized as a Rubber Tap by placing it on a Rubber Tree Log that is naturally grown (not directly placed by the player). The tap will fill with Rubber liquid over time. After the tap fills completely, it can be removed by simply breaking it, yielding a Rubber Bucket of the corresponding bucket type. Its rubber can also be transferred to another bucket by simply right-clicking any empty Bucket type on the tap, leaving the tap on and draining it so it can tap more liquid rubber.

Syrmorite Rubber Taps are superior to Weedwood Rubber Taps in that they tap Rubber slightly faster, and that the buckets they yield when broken can be reused.

Fuel
------

Weedwood Rubber Taps can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace, smelting 1.5 items per tap block.
