Puddles in-game.

Puddles as they used to appear prior to Release 3.6.0

**Puddles** are watery overlays that generate on top of uncovered opaque blocks exposed to the sky during the Heavy Rain event.

They can also spread to adjacent blocks even if that block's sky access is blocked. When the rain stops, they will disappear slowly over time.

Coloration
------------

Puddles take on different water tints depending on the biome they are located in.

Movement
----------

Puddles do not hinder movement, and will make splashing noises and particles when walked through by the player.

Crops
-------

Puddles that generate over crops will instantly destroy said crop, dropping nothing. Note that this only applies to crops with multiple growth stages, that being Aspectrus, White Pears, and Yellow Dotted Fungus, and no other plants. In the case of Aspectrus, Puddles will even destroy the Fence post it's growing on.

This makes covering crops extremely important.

Collection
------------

Puddles cannot be harvested or collected in any way, although they can be obtained as an item from the Creative Inventory.

---------

* Release 3.6.0: New Puddle models and textures
