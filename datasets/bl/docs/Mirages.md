Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Betweenstone Bricks Mirages are found in the Wight Fortress. Compacted Mud Mirages are found in the Crypt of the Sludgeon.

Properties
------------

### Phasing
Mirages appear identical to a block commonly found in the structure they generate in (Betweenstone Bricks in the case of Betweenstone Bricks Mirages, or Compacted Mud in the case of Compacted Mud Mirages). However, they can be passed through by any player or mob without collision, as if they were air.

Secrets

The details on where Mirages are found and what secrets they conceal are hidden below in a spoiler tab; *DO NOT* open this tab if you do not wish to be spoiled.

| **Secret** | **Picture** |
| On the first floor of the Wight Fortress, there is a back wall in the center room that appears to be made out of Betweenstone Bricks instead of the usual Betweenstone. There are two hidden entryways here concealed by Betweenstone Bricks Mirages. Behind these Mirages is a small hidden room containing a double Weedwood Chest. |  |
| After reaching the Crypt Tunnels of the Sludgeon, the player would normally have to go through the entire tunnel to reach the Crypt. However, there is a small hidden entryway near the beginning of the tunnel concealed by Compacted Mud Mirages, facing the opposite direction. The Crypt is directly behind these Mirages, allowing for easy entrance without having to go through the Crypt Crawler Tunnel Entrances. The Mirages can be accessed from the other side as well, from the wall to the left of where the Ancient Greatsword is found, for easy exit. |  |
| Inside the Crypt of the Sludgeon, there is another small hidden entryway concealed by Compacted Mud Mirages, on the back wall to the right of the main entrance. Behind these Mirages is a very small hidden room containing an Armor Stand with a full set of Ancient Armor. |  |
