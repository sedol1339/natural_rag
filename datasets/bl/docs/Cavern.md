# Cavern

[Aside block] Cavern
--------------------

### Type

Natural

### Generation

Anywhere between the surface and Lake Cavern layers

### Water Color

#131844 (fades in from the surface down)

A large descending Cavern with Limestone

A very dark Cavern, near the bottom of the layer

The **Cavern** layer of The Betweenlands begins just below the surface, at a Y-layer of 100, and continues down until it reaches the Lake Cavern layer, at Y=45.

The caves can range from very small to tremendously large, and contain many ores and unique plants. There are sometimes small breaks on the surface which lead to these caverns, and occasionally giant ravines creating deep cuts in the earth that expose ores and other potential systems of caves. Occasionally large seams of limestone, often called Limestone Caverns, can be found. The fog is very dense down here, and an alternative ambient track plays, slowly fading in from the surface ambience starting from Y=110 downwards. There are also additional cave ambience noises that play occasionally.

The Cavern layer has a location title that appears briefly to players who enter it.

* Stalactite, in formations on the floor or ceiling
* Moss, in patches
* Lichen, in patches
* Cave Moss, in clusters hanging from the ceiling
* Thorns, in clusters hanging from the ceiling
* Limestone, in large, relatively uncommon seams from Y=95 to Y=45
* Sulfur Ore, in common veins from Y=100 to Y=45
* Slimy Bone Ore, in uncommon veins from Y=100 to Y=45
* Octine Ore, in relatively common veins from Y=70 to Y=45
* Syrmorite Ore, in uncommon veins from Y=100 to Y=85
* Pot of Chance, in very uncommon, large clusters

  Simulacrums, rarely in the various levels.

Mobs
------

Swamp Hags, Wights, Chiromaws, Infestations, Stalkers and Boulder Sprites can spawn down here, and rarely Harlequin Toads if the above biome supports them.
