The Story of The Betweenlands
-------------------------------

In the beginning, when the Overworld's light was just beginning to shine and the eternal flames of the Nether had just begun to burn, a vast empty space lay between the two realms, floating within the Void.

Though it was dark and lifeless, wisps of raw energy that remained from the dawn of time flowed here, thus giving it the potential to expand into a complete, self-contained dimension.

All it needed was the smallest spark of life.

By some strange cosmic coincidence, something extraordinary happened.

As the fabric of reality shifted, a thin, narrow crack appeared high up in the sky above the Overworld.

This crack was an interdimensional rift between the realms of Minecraftia, acting as a doorway to the long-empty space that lay between.

Lifeforce surged through the rift from the Overworld and planted the seed of creation on the other side.

The Betweenlands was born.

As time passed, creatures evolved into a race of NPCs which inhabited the young dimension.

These people were strong, proud and hard-working.

Over many centuries they built up a vast and mighty civilization.

Though these people were kind and caring at heart, they all shared a tremendous lust for power, in particular the ability to wield great magic.

This flaw would eventually become the catalyst of their demise.

A wise and powerful Sorcerer rose to power, who was fluent in the language of magic, Java.

The Sorcerer believed that if they could harness the dark forces of the Nether, they would be able to use the power as a tool of creation.

The Sorcerer and their followers worked tirelessly to conjure up the elements required to open up a portal from their world to the fiery pits of the Nether.

Eventually, the time came to light the frame of Obsidian.

Little did they know, it would destroy their world.

As soon as the portal had been opened, a great evil swept across the land from the portal like blood from a wound.

One by one, the people of the Betweenlands were transformed into Wights; beings of pure hatred, neither living nor dead.

The darkness consumed all.

Once the surge of dark energy had subsided, the once-great Sorcerer opened their eyes.

But they did not breathe, for they were no longer truly living.

They too had become a Wight, their mind, body and soul corrupted.

Their head hung low, with a sad, mournful expression playing across their face.

But they did not feel grief... they did not feel anything at all any more.

Only burning malice within.

The Sorcerer had become the Prime Wight, with an army of Wights to serve and do their bidding.

They had got just what they had wanted; they now wielded unimaginable power.

Meanwhile, in the Overworld, this activity had not gone without notice.

A small covenant of Druids attempted to heal the wounds left behind, but upon being exposed to this power, slowly became insane.

It seemed that all was lost until after many long years, a remarkable individual decided they needed to step in.

This brave young soul went by the name of (**player name**) and was well known for creating amazing architectural designs and redstone contraptions.

They valiantly defeated the powerful Dark Druids, and took possession of the uncompleted Talisman, a magical tool needed to open a portal to The Betweenlands.

Using an altar, a device keyed into the energies of the Betweenlands, the Talisman was carefully assembled and what the Druids has originally set out to do was finally completed.

The portal, was opened.

(player name) met and befriended the many nomadic tribes of the land, and agreed to help them in exchange for the ancient relics needed to bypass the defenses and travel to the Prime Wight's Domain.

There, they would face the beast itself alone, and free the land of its terrible curse.

(player name) dropped down into the dark depths below, unknowing of what they would find.

The battle was long and hard, and the Wight's dark energies took its toll on the (player name).

Despite this, they remarkably pulled through, and the tyrant was dead.

Hundreds of thousands of years of pain and suffering was over at last.

The blanket of shade was lifted, and light shone upon the forgotten realm once more.

The Wights were forced back down to the fiery pits from whence they came, deep down in the Nether.

The people of The Betweenlands were overjoyed, and celebrated in their saviour's name.

A great festival was created in their honour, and is held once every year on the (current date).

The name of that bold adventurer will be passed down through generations, undying, never forgotten...

(player name), you have saved the world.
