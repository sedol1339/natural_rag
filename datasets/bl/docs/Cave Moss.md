Placement
-----------

Cave Moss can only be placed on the underside of Betweenstone, Limestone, and Pitstone, as well as directly below itself. Breaking a higher part of a Cave Moss growth will break all parts below it as well.

Particles
-----------

Cave Moss will occasionally drip water particles.

Collection
------------

Cave Moss must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, it instead drops a Cave Moss (item), which can then be ground into Ground Cave Moss.

Growth
--------

Cave Moss that has been placed directly by the player grows down from blocks like Vines.

Compostability
----------------

Cave Moss has a compost process time of 7 minutes and 30 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Igniting
----------

Cave Moss can be used to create fire by holding right-click on either its placed or dropped form with an Octine Ingot. Cave Moss that is adjacent to or on a Block of Octine will also catch fire, although this fire will not spread to further Cave Moss blocks.
