**Braziers** are double-tall blocks that spawn unlit on top of the Sludgeon Tower of the Sludgeon, and lit in the Pit of Decay beneath it.

Lighting
----------

Braziers can be lit via any method of placing fire available. In The Betweenlands, the only method is by placing or dropping Moss, Cave Moss, Lichen, or Thorns (or the corresponding Plant Item or Ground Item) on top of the Brazier and igniting it with an Octine Ingot. The fire will be sustained indefinitely, until it is removed through manual means.

### Tower Puzzle
Each Brazier on top of the Sludgeon Tower will send a small orange shader beam to the Beam Origin when lit. Once all four Braziers are lit, the origin will begin generating a green shader beam directly downwards, activating the puzzle needed to open the Dungeon Door to the Labyrinthine Vaults, and each of the Braziers will spawn an Emberling Shaman.
