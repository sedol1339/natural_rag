Description
-------------

Sporelings appear as very small entities with brown-capped mushroom heads dotted with yellow spots. When a player is nearby, it will run away from them as fast as it can, leaving a colorful trail of particles behind. If it falls off a high place, it will inflate its head to float down in a chicken-esque manner and avoid taking fall damage.

Sporelings are attracted to Root Sprites. They have a chance to spawn while riding Gecko. During the Blood Sky event, they will spawn with Splodeshrooms on their heads and run at the player.

Sporelings can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.
