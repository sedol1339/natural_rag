Description
-------------

Temple Guardians are sentient temple statues wielding various weaponry and possessing red eyes. When not attacking, they will sit still in a specific pose, acting as a statue. When the player comes near they will come alive and proceed to attack. They have different types of attacks depending on their variation. In addition, they have a chance to have a Middle Gem Circle modifier applied to them, which can alter their abilities and the strategy one uses to defeat them.

Melee Guardian: The standard guardian, armed with a sword and shield. It will stride toward its opponent and attack it with basic melee, although the attack is rather strong.

Ranged Guardian: Armed with a ranged weapon. The guardian's movement and health are rather low, but they have great range and shooting speed with their weapon.

Berserker Guardian: Armed with two hammers. To attack, it storms in a straight line directly at the player with great speed, dealing a large amount of melee damage if it hits you. It will keep running this direction until it hits something or reaches the initial location of the player, when it has a short cooldown before attacking again.

Trivia
--------

* The "TempleGuardianMeleeLiving2" sound that Melee Guardians sometimes make, if you listen closely, sounds like the guardian is saying "kill it".
* The original pots of chance seem to have been made for the temple.
