Obtaining

### Drops
Silk Grub Cocoons drop from breaking Silk Cocooned Weedwood Bushes.

### Shearing
Silk Grub Cocoons are harvested by shearing a Silk Cocooned Weedwood Bush with Syrmorite Shears, turning it into a regular Weedwood Bush in the process. This yields twice as many cocoons as breaking the bush.
