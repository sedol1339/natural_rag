A Dungeon Door being unlocked

**Dungeon Doors** are special gates found in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon. They come in a normal, **Mimic**, and **Crypt** variant.

Each door takes up a vertical 3x3 area, and block entry to various parts of the Sludgeon, requiring a combination to open.

Unlocking
-----------

### Surface
The first Dungeon Door is located on the surface, near the base of the Sludgeon Tower. This door has a lens on its center piece, and must be opened by directing the Beam Origin's beam through the tower's Beam Lenses and Beam Passages, onto the center piece. Once the beam reaches the door, it will open and provide access to the first layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults.

### Vaults
Each layer of the vaults has a Dungeon Door that must be opened in order to gain access to the layer below it. These doors can be opened by solving a combination on their center piece. At the beginning of each layer is a Dungeon Door Code with a randomly generated rune, consisting of three pieces. The player can right-click the top, middle, or bottom of a Dungeon Door's center to shift the combination. Once each section matches the Door Code's rune, the door will open.

The correct combination does not change if the Dungeon Door Code's combination is shifted. Player-placed Dungeon Doors also cannot be set with their own codes, even by changing code combinations or placing new codes.

Any Dungeon Door except the surface one can be immediately opened without needing the combination by right-clicking it with a Rune Door Key.

Combinations
--------------

The following is a list of all combination pieces. Each section has 8 possible shapes, meaning there are 512 possible combinations.

| Dungeon Rune Pieces | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Top Section** | **Middle Section** | **Bottom Section** |
| Top 1 | Middle 1 | Bottom 1 |
| Top 2 | Middle 2 | Bottom 2 |
| Top 3 | Middle 3 | Bottom 3 |
| Top 4 | Middle 4 | Bottom 4 |
| Top 5 | Middle 5 | Bottom 5 |
| Top 6 | Middle 6 | Bottom 6 |
| Top 7 | Middle 7 | Bottom 7 |
| Top 8 | Middle 8 | Bottom 8 |

Mimic
-------

A Dungeon Door Mimic being unlocked

The 4th level of the Vaults houses an additional Mimic door. When opened, it will collapse outward and spawn a Barrishee. The Barrishee is a difficult encounter, but when killed drops a Rune Door Key. Opening the mimic door also provides access to the Barrishee Lair, a small room filled with various loot, most notably the Ancient Battle Axe.

Crypt
-------

The 6th layer of the vaults houses an additional Crypt Door. When opened, it will collapse outward and spawn a Crypt Crawler with an Octine Sword and Syrmorite Shield. Opening this door provides access to the Winding Walkways, narrow mud corridors that eventually lead to the Crypt Tunnels and finally the Crypt, a room containing the Ancient Greatsword and a set of Ancient Armor, among other loot.

Destructibility
-----------------

Dungeon Doors cannot be broken directly by the player in Survival Mode. However, they can be destroyed by explosions if they are not under block protection.
