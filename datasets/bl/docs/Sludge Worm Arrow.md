| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |

| **Sludge Worm Arrow** | Sludge Worm Egg Sac + Life Crystal (3% charge) + Sulfur (6) |  |

Shooting
----------

Like vanilla Arrows, Basilisk Arrows can be shot from any Bow, including a Weedwood Bow or Predator Bow. The velocity they are shot at depends on how far back the bow is pulled, as well as how corroded it is. The arrows deal damage based on their velocity to whatever entity they hit. If they do not hit an entity, they will instead stick into the block they land on and can then be picked up, but will eventually despawn if left untouched.

Additionally, shot Sludge Worm Arrows spawn a Tiny Sludge Worm Helper on entities they hit. Unlike their hostile variant, the Sludge Worme Helpers have 30 health (x15) and deal 3 contact damage () to their target. If the Sludge Worm Helper has no available target nearby, it will eventually despawn after a few minutes.

Uses
------

### Lightning Effects
If Betweenlands Lightning strikes one or more dropped Sludge Worm Arrow items, they will transform into Shock Arrows, at a maximum exchange of 5 arrows per strike.
