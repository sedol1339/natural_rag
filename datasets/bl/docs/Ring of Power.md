Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ring of Power** (5 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (12% charge) |  |

How to Equip
--------------

The Ring of Power can be right-clicked to equip it onto the player in an invisible slot beside the hotbar. Note that only two rings can be equipped at a time.

The Ring of Power is equipped through the Radial Equipment Menu, which is opened by pressing C (by default). It displays any ring equipped onto the player (in red tab) as well as rings in their inventory (in green tab). A ring can be both equipped and unequipped with a left click, allowing for easy management of ring equipping.

Effect
--------

When equipped, the Ring of Power will give an additional 50% boost to the player's damage output. While active, the ring will receive an enchantment glow, and an additional green flame particle effect will be added to those struck by the player's attacks.

The Ring of Power's charge will drain while it is active, and it will run out after about half an hour of being active. The ring's charge can be replenished by right-clicking the ring, consuming the player's experience to recharge the ring to full power. The amount of experience consumed depends on the amount of the ring's charge that needs to be replenished. Charge cannot be replenished through an Animator.
