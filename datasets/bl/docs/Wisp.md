Wisps ingame

**Wisps** are strange blocks that generate in Marsh and Deep Waters biomes. They can also be found around natural Spirit Trees and as part of Cragrock Towers. They can also be created by a Simulacra effect.

Appearance & Collection
-------------------------

Wisps take on either an orange, purple, blue, or green color, and give off corresponding colored light. On normal occasions, when a player attempts to come close to one, it will vanish until they move far enough away again. When vanished, they cannot be broken unless a block is placed on them or using the /setblock command, and even then they will not drop as an item. However, during the Auroras event, Wisps will not vanish when a player get close to them, and only then can they be collected as an item to place elsewhere.

In Cragrock Towers, Wisps are initially invisible, but when approached will individually ignite, one by one, and are visible from up close and can be collected regardless of the Auroras event.

Wisps that are found on the ruins surrounding a Spirit Tree are visible and collectible from any distance.

The Wisp rendering quality can be edited in the config.

Effects on Spirit Trees
-------------------------

Wisps around a Spirit Tree have an effect on the strength and drops of the tree. Removing naturally spawned Wisps form the ruins will decreased the damage and speed of the tree's attacks while also reducing the amount of experience the Large Spirit Tree Face drops. On the other hand, adding new wisps to the ruins will increase the damage and speed of the tree's attacks while also increasing the amount of experience the Large Face drops and allowing it to drop more items. Any added Wisps, as well as all Wisps after the Large Face reaches 50% health or below, will become protected and cannot be removed until the Large Face is defeated. See the Spirit Tree page for more information on the effects of Wisps.
