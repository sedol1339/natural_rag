Throwing
----------

Holding down right-click with a Silky Pebble causes it to begin pulling back, flashing red, smoking, and hissing, all of which are warning signs for its destructive nature. If you let go of the key before the pebble pulls back all the way, it will not be thrown. This prevents it from being accidentally thrown and causing unintended destruction.

When let go at full pullback, the Silky Pebble will be thrown, let out a muffled moan, and create a significant explosion upon contacting a block or entity. All blocks that this explosion destroyed will drop their true forms, as if broken with Silk Touch. This does not work for a certain few blocks, such as Mist/Shadow blocks or Pots.
