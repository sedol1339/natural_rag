Sludge, as it used to appear before its texture was updated.

*Not to be confused with Sludgy Dirt or the Sludge; the mob.*

**Sludge** is a thin, layer-type block left behind in trails on opaque blocks by Sludges.

Movement
----------

Sludge slows down the movement of players and non-Betweenlands mobs greatly when walked over, and prevents them from jumping as well. Unlike most other slowing blocks, there is no way to negate this slowing effect, not even with Rubber Boots.

Betweenlands mobs are not slowed by Sludge.

Collection
------------

Sludge drops nothing when harvested, and the blocks themselves cannot be obtained in survival mode.

However, they can be mined with a Shovel to collect a Sludge Ball.

History
---------

* Beta 1.0.0: Introduced.
