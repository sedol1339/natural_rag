The Dual Sulfur Furnace ingame

The dual Smelting interface. The new flux slots are colour-coded based on the coloured text to the left.

The **Dual Sulfur Furnace** is a craftable utility block that acts functionally very similarly to the Sulfur Furnace, but is capable of smelting two items at once.

How to Use
------------

The smelting interface can be accessed by right-clicking the Dual Sulfur Furnace. Smelting works nearly identically to smelting in a vanilla Furnace, featuring the usual input, fuel, and output slots to cook or process items into new ones. However, the fuel sources that are used will likely be different when working in the Betweenlands.

The difference between a regular Sulfur Furnace and a Dual Sulfur Furnace is that the Dual one has two slots for inputs, fuels, and outputs. This means that it is capable of smelting two different items at once, acting as two Sulfur Furnaces but only taking up one block space.

The following is a list of all items from the Betweenlands that can be used as fuel in a Dual Sulfur Furnace, as well as the number of items each is capable of smelting before running out.

While smelting, the Dual Sulfur Furnace will emit light and produce fire, as well as make a crackling fire sound.

In addition, there are new, optional left slots in the Dual Sulfur Furnace interface. These slots are capable of accepting Limestone Flux and give Octine Ore and Syrmorite Ore smelted in their part of the furnace a chance to yield two ingots instead of just one. One Limestone Flux item will always be consumed from this slot whenever the ore is smelted, and the duplication will not work with any other smelted items.
