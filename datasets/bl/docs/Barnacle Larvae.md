Farming
---------

Barnacle Larvae can be placed on any side of a block underwater and will grow on their own. Once harvested at full maturity, the block will drop Barnacle Flesh and more **Barnacle Larvae**.

When placed on the side of a Tarred Hearthgrove Log, Barnacle Larvae will grow significantly faster and at a more consistent rate (about 14x faster).
