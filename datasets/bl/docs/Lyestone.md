Obtaining
-----------

### Generation
Lyestone will rarely generate in patches of exposed Limestone found in caves underground.

Properties
------------

### Particles
Lyestone continuously emits Bubble-like particles that pop and splatter from its top.

### Damage
Lyestone behaves similarly to the vanilla Magma block, continuously damaging any non-fire-resistant mob that stands on top of it. Sneaking or wearing boots while on top of the block prevents the player from taking damage, although mobs will continue to take damage even with boots.

### Block Corrosion
Walking over Lyestone while wearing boots will cause the player's boots to become "corrosive", causing blocks the player walks on to fall if they aren't supported below, similar to Weak Blocks and the blocks on the Sludgeon Tower's staircase. Sneaking or Creative mode will prevent blocks from collapsing, however.

Note that this effect doesn't work on unbreakable blocks, or those protected by a structure's ward. Fallen blocks also don't drop as an item when landing on non-full blocks, unlike vanilla falling blocks.

This corrosive effect can be removed from the boots simply by stepping into Swamp Water or vanilla water while wearing them.
