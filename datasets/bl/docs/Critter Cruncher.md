Animating Recipe
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critter Cruncher** (20 weight) | Item Scroll + Sulfur (16) + Life Crystal (12% charge) |  |

Attacking
-----------

Against most mobs, the Critter Cruncher only deals its minimum base damage; however, it will instantly kill any 'critters' (includes Blood Snails, Chiromaws, Dragonflies, Fireflies, Infestations, Leeches, Mire Snails, Sporelings and Termites) it is used against, making it very useful. Like all Betweenlands tools, the Critter Cruncher deals more damage in the Betweenlands than vanilla tools.

Repairing
-----------

Unlike most other equipment with durability, there is no way to repair a damaged Critter Cruncher.

Corrosion
-----------

The Critter Cruncher is found in a "Good as new!" state of corrosion, with 0/255 corrosion points. Simply having it in your inventory will cause it to start corroding; using and swinging it as well as being in water will increase its rate of corrosion. Corrosion decreases its damage output.

A corroded Critter Cruncher can be cleaned in the Purifier, resetting its corrosion value back to 0.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Critter Cruncher** | Corroded and uncoated **Critter Cruncher** + Sulfur + Swamp Water (250 mB) |  |

A Critter Cruncher can also be applied with Scabyst to give it up to 600 coating points, which keep the corrosion level static until they are depleted.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coats **Critter Cruncher** (75 points per piece) | **Critter Cruncher** + Scabyst (1-8) |  |

Finally, a corroded Critter Cruncher can be applied with Sap Spit to directly remove up to 255 corrosion points from it. Unlike the Purifier method, this can be done on a Critter Cruncher that is simultaneously coated with Scabyst.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Removes Corrosion from **Critter Cruncher** (85 points per item) | Any corroded **Critter Cruncher** + Sap Spit (1-8) |  |

Visit the Mechanics page for more details on corrosion.

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, the Critter Cruncher can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player using it. The type of gem equipped can be seen in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to **Critter Cruncher** | **Critter Cruncher** + Any Middle Gem |  |

Advancements
--------------

| Advancement | In-game Description | Parent | Actual Requirements | ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical Hit | Slay a critter with a **Critter Cruncher** | Chopping Boy | Kill a Blood Snail, Dragonfly, Firefly, Leech, Mire Snail, Sporeling, or Termite with a **Critter Cruncher** | fighter /critical\_hit |
