Spawning
----------

Dragonflies spawn in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Patchy Islands biomes.

Behavior
----------

Dragonflies usually fly around aimlessly, but fly away from players. When the player is far enough, they land on the ground and rest. When a player comes close enough, they start to fly away, making it tricky to hit them.

Dragonflies can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Critter Cruncher.

### Catching
Dragonflies can be right-clicked with a Net to capture them as an inventory item. This item can then be right-clicked on the ground to release the Dragonfly as an entity there.

### Feeding
Caught Dragonfly items have a chance to be desired by a hatched Chiromaw Hatchling juvenile, as part of the process of raising it. If desired, they can be right-clicked onto the juvenile to feed it.

Drops
-------

The drops from Dragonflies are derived from the dragonfly loot table.

The following is a list of all of the items that can be dropped by Dragonflies, including their rolls, quantities, and weights.
