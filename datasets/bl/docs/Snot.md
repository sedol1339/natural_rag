Obtaining
-----------

### Drops
Snot drops from Rock Snots upon death.

Uses
------

### Feeding
Snot can be right-clicked on an Olm to feed it, causing it to produce an Olm Egg Cluster. A single Olm can only be fed Snot once every 20 minutes.

### Upgrading
Snot can be used as an upgrade for the Amphibious Chestplate by shift right-clicking the armor piece and placing the item in one or more of its upgrade slots (up to 3 can be placed in each slot). Having a slot with a Snot upgrade causes the *full* armor set to provide full mining speed underwater when equipped.

Each Snot item at the top of an upgrade stack will receive durability damage when the armor itself is damaged, and will retain this durability loss even if taken out of the armor, becoming unstackable with other Snot items. Each item has a maximum durability of 64 before breaking, and the armor will then start using the next item down if it was stacked.
