A largely explored Amate Map

**Amate Maps** are craftable items that map the surface of The Betweenlands, with markers for biomes and structures.

They have two versions, an **Empty** map and a filled-in map.

Crafting Recipe

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty Amate Map | Amate Paper (8) + Any Middle Gem |  |

How to Use
------------

Like a vanilla Map, the Amate Map starts empty, and can be "activated" with right-click to begin mapping an area. Each map covers an area of 2048-by-2048 blocks (128-by-128 chunks), the same as a fully expanded vanilla Map, but cannot be expanded further or shrunken.

The player's location on the map is pinpointed by a white marker. As the player moves, they will fill in the Map in a small radius around themselves. If the player goes over the edge of the map, their location relative to it will be displayed with a large dot marker.

When the player is not in the Betweenlands, their Amate Map marker will remain in their last identified location within the dimension. Empty Amate Maps cannot be opened outside of the Betweenlands.

Map Legend
------------

Unlike a vanilla Map, the Amate Map's colours do not label specific blocks, but rather biomes and their borders. Each biome in the Betweenlands has a unique color on the map, separated by a dark border. Additionally, the Map will display unique markers for generated structures. This makes the map more useful as an exploratory tool for marking biomes and structures than as a means of locating player-built structures.

The following is a list of biome colours and structure markers:

| Biome Color Key | |
| --- | --- |
| **Color** | **Biome** |
|  | Biome Border |
|  | Coarse Islands |

|  | Raised Isles |
|  | Sludge Plains |
|  | Sludge Plains Clearing |
|  | Swamplands |
