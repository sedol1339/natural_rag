**Sludge Jet Turrets** are turret mobs that spawn at the 4 level of the Labyrinthine Vaults, and the upper balconies of the Pit of Decay in the Sludgeon.

Description
-------------

Sludge Jet Turrets are animated turret mobs found in the Sludgeon. They appear as small, head-sized, slowly spinning objects that emit a cloud of brown particles around them.

Sludge Jet Turrets shoot sludge at the player from its "sides", dealing 2 hearts of damage. They can only be hurt from the "front", but can be killed in one hit by any attack, even ones that would normally do no damage, like the vanilla Snowball.

Strategy
----------

To kill a Sludge Jet Turret, the player must hit the "mask" part with the glowing yellow eye. If they hit any other side of the mob, their attack will do no damage.

The best strategy against them is to use a shield or bow, or to simply stand in front of the mob, making it unable to hit the player. Due to their low health and damage, they rarely pose much of a threat on their own, but hitting their mask may be difficult when dealing with a group of enemies.

History
---------

* Release 3.7.1: Updated Spawn Egg colors.
