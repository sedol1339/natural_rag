**Marshes** are Betweenlands biomes characterized by small, very flat landmasses scattered in Swamp Water, with large quantities of tall, reedy grasses and sparse Weedwood Trees.

There are two variants, **Marsh 0** and **Marsh 1**, that can spawn independently of each other and contain slightly different topography.

Fog in general is thicker in a Marsh biome than in other biomes. During the Dense Fog event, the fog is even thicker and "They" appear more frequently.
