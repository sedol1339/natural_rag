Crafting Recipes
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lurker Skin Helmet | Lurker Skin (5) |  |
| Lurker Skin Chestplate | Lurker Skin (8) |  |
| Lurker Skin Leggings | Lurker Skin (7) |  |
| Lurker Skin Boots | Lurker Skin (4) |  |

Stats
-------

A full set of Lurker Skin Armor provides 7 armor points, or 3.5 armor icons, and absorbs 28% of damage from the player at the expense of durability. Lurker Skin Boots allow the player to float at one elevation in water. Each armor piece worn increases underwater mining speed, as well as underwater movement speed if worn alongside the boots. Wearing full Lurker Skin Armor will also provide better underwater vision and decreased rate at which breath goes down.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, any damaged piece of Lurker Skin Armor can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully repairs corresponding **Lurker Skin Armor** piece | Any damaged **Lurker Skin Armor** piece + Sulfur (5-10) + Life Crystal (4-13% charge) |  |

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, all pieces of Lurker Skin Armor can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player wearing them. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the armor as well as in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies corresponding Middle Gem to corresponding **Lurker Skin Armor** piece | Any **Lurker Skin Armor** piece + Any Middle Gem |  |

Corrosion
-----------

Lurker Skin Armor does not corrode.
