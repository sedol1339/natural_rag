**Ruins** are a variety of small, dilapidated structures that generate in Marsh and Sludge Plains biomes. They have different block compositions and designs depending on the biome, and sometimes contain pots with loot.

Ruins have a world location that identifies the area they take up, as well as a title that appears briefly to players who approach them.
