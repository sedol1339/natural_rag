Worm Pillars ingame

**Worm Pillars** are craftable building blocks. They have a normal variant and a Cap variant, each of which has five increasingly Sludgy variants that use connected textures. In addition to being crafted, all variants can be found as part of the Sludgeon, the level of "sludginess" increasing with deeper levels.
