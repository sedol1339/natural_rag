Particles
-----------

Small fiery particles will occasionally emanate from Hearthgrove Logs, as well as small black particles from Tarred Hearthgrove Logs. If the log is in water, bubbles and steam will form around it instead.

Spawning
----------

All varieties of Hearthgrove Log support the spawning of Emberlings in Patchy Islands biomes, although they are rare.

Fuel
------

Any variety of Hearthgrove Log can be used as fuel for the Sulfur Furnace or Dual Sulfur Furnace.

Either normal variant of Hearthgrove Log can smelt 4.0 items per log. Either tarred variant of Hearthgrove Log can smelt 24.0 items per log, making it a very substantial fuel upgrade.
