Spawning
----------

Ash Sprites have a chance to spawn upon breaking urns from Dungeon Alcoves, which generate in the Labyrinthine Vaults and Crypt of the Sludgeon. Additionally, when a Barrishee screams, nearby alcove urns and Urns of Chance will break and Ash Sprites will always spawn from them.

Behaviour
-----------

Ash Sprites float around, phasing through blocks similarly to vanilla Vexes. Upon targeting a player, they will drift a safe distance away from them before rushing towards them, dealing contact damage. They may get multiple hits in as they swoop around their target before drifting back out of melee range.

Strategy
----------

The best way to deal with Ash Sprites is to avoid breaking Urn of Chance in the Labyrinthine Vaults altogether. If multiple urns are broken, the player may be overwhelmed by the Ash Sprites. Breaking one pot at a time is highly recommended, as the Ash Sprites can be easily dealt with. They will often pass through blocks, so try to predict the Ash Sprite's movement to keep track of it. Upon taking a hit, they will briefly be unable to phase through walls. Eventually, the Ash Sprite will stop attacking the player from behind and attack them head-on. This is the best window for the player to counterattack. Voodoo Dolls are highly effective against them, since they do not need to be aimed and will simply damage any mobs nearby.

Drops
-------

The drops from Ash Sprites are derived from the ash\_sprite loot table.
