**Giant Weedwood Trees** are massive trees found in The Betweenlands. They generate uncommonly in Swamplands, Coarse Islands, and Marsh biomes, but cannot be grown, not even with Weedwood Saplings.

Giant Weedwood Trees have a world location that identifies the area they take up.

Description
-------------

Around 60 blocks tall and around 70 blocks wide, Giant Weedwood Trees feature a massive trunk with large supporting roots and branches. Each has multiple wide, bushy clusters of leaves that make up their sprawling canopy, drooped with Hangers. They are so large that they significantly darken the area beneath them.

In Swamplands biomes, Giant Weedwood Trees are usually cut off from the base, leaving only a large stump behind, with no leaves, Hangers, or a world location. Unlike whole trees, they are also often covered in Poison Ivy. Only whole Giant Weedwood Trees will appear with a map icon on an Amate Map.

Even moreso than regular Weedwood Trees, Giant Weedwood Trees are a great source of wood. They are also the main sources of Dentrothyst, a resource used extensively in Herblore, and the only source of Seeded Hangers, which drop White Pear Seeds used to grow White Pear plants.

Composition
-------------

Giant Weedwood Trees consist of:

* Weedwood Log, as the outer bark, root and branch block
* Weedwood, as the inner trunk, root and branch block
* Weedwood Leaves, as the leaf block on whole trees
* Shelf Fungus, in side shelf formations
* Dentrothysts, scattered uncommonly inside the trunk
* Hanger, hanging from the leaves of whole trees (both seeded and unseeded)
* Poison Ivy, occasionally on the bark of stumps only

Mobs
------

Pyrads occasionally spawn on and around living Giant Weedwood Trees. Sporelings can also spawn on the Shelf Fungus found around the trunks.
