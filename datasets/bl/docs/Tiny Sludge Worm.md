Spawning
----------

### Egg Sacs
Tiny Sludge Worms are spawned in groups of four from Sludge Worm Egg Sacs when a player comes near them. Egg Sacs spawn naturally on the third layer of the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon, and are also spawned by Large Sludge Worms and the Sludge Menace.

### Tunnel Entrances
Tiny Sludge Worms can spawn from Tunnel Entrances on the surface anywhere in The Betweenlands during the Heavy Rain event.

### Farming
Tiny Sludge Worms can spawn when digging holes (around 10% chance, not impacted by weather) for compost to grow plants or crops.

### Peat Mummy Riders
Swamp Hags that spawn on top of Peat Mummies as riders throw Tiny Sludge Worms as a ranged attack.

### Arrows
When a Sludge Worm Arrow shot from a Bow hits a mob, it will spawn a Tiny Sludge Worm Helper that will attack the mob hit by the arrow as well as any other hostile mobs nearby.

Description
-------------

Tiny Sludge Worms are small white worms with brown heads. They can be 'squashed' by jumping on them, killing them instantly. Doing this gives the player Nausea and Elixir of Decay effects for 3 seconds. Using a Net on one will give the player the worm in item form. Unlike other Sludge Worms, they are hostile to all non-Betweenlands mobs. When hit by a shockwave from the Shockwave Sword, they will "surf" on the shockwave as it knocks them back.

Drops
-------

The drops from Tiny Sludge Worms and Tiny Sludge Worm Helpers are derived from two loot tables: tiny\_sludge\_worm and tiny\_sludge\_worm\_helper, respectively. However, tiny\_sludge\_worm\_helper contains no content by default.

The following is a list of all of the items that can be dropped by Tiny Sludge Worms, including their rolls, quantities, and weights.
