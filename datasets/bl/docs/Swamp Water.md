Swamp Water while underwater

**Swamp Water** is the primary water liquid of The Betweenlands. It generates in vast quantities on the surface in Deep Waters, Coarse Islands, and Patchy Islands biomes, and in smaller quantities in Marsh, Swamplands, and Sludge Plains biomes, between Y-layers 120 (the Betweenlands sea level) and 100 (at maximum depth). It also generates occasionally as small lakes atop Raised Islands, as well as deep underground in Lake Caverns, where it floods caves from Y=15 to Y=0.

Coloration
------------

Swamp Water takes on different water colors depending on what biome or layer it is in. The water color is:

* #1B3944 in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Deep Waters biomes
* #485E18 in Marsh biomes
* #184220 in Patchy Islands, Swamplands, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #3A2F0B in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #131844 in the Cavern and Lake Cavern layers (fades in from the surface down to Y=15)

Particles
-----------

Small particles resembling fish will occasionally swim in Swamp Water. Additionally, particles resembling mosquitoes and flies will occasionally float around Swamp Water when it is shallow and lies above Mud.

Physics
---------

Swamp Water acts similarly to vanilla Water, flowing at the same speed and capable of creating infinite source blocks. They do not, however, create infinite source blocks with vanilla Water, nor do they usually take priority over one another. Though, when interacting with Lava, it can create vanilla Stone (flowing touching source), vanilla Cobblestone (flowing touching flowing) and Obsidian (source touching source or flowing). It will not, however, create Betweenstone, Limestone, Pitstone or Cragrock (as of this version's edit). Should one ever wish to bring lava, for whatever reason, they should know that they will be unable to create a Betweenstone generator for these purposes.

Drowning
----------

Swamp Water will begin drowning players and mobs that are completely submerged in it, after draining their breath meter. It deals 2 damage () per drowning tick.

Water Plants
--------------

Swamp Water supports the placement and/or growth of certain water-based plants under the right conditions, such as Swamp Reeds, Swamp Kelp, Water Weeds, Bog Beans, Golden Clubs, Marsh Marigolds, Mire Coral, Deep Water Coral, and Bladderworts.

Tar
-----

Upon contacting Tar, Swamp Water will form Solid Tar. This will occur regardless of whether either liquid is a source block or flowing.

Collection
------------

Swamp Water can be collected with a Weedwood or Syrmorite Bucket, but can also be collected with vanilla Buckets, among other forms of collection outside of the Betweenlands.

Purifier
----------

When collected in a Bucket, Swamp Water can be used to fill the Purifier, which is required in order to purify items. One Purifier can be filled with up to four Buckets worth of water, and consumes one Bucket worth per four purified items.

Events
--------

During the Winter event, the surface of Swamp Water will slowly freeze over from land edges without enough light, turning into Black Ice. When a light source is placed near it, or after the event ends, this Black Ice will eventually melt back into Swamp Water. Swamp Water is also left behind when Black Ice is broken.
