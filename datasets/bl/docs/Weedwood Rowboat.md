A Weedwood Rowboat ingame

The **Weedwood Rowboat** is a vehicle that functions as an equivalent to a vanilla Boat in The Betweenlands, capable of transporting a player more easily across bodies of water.

There are two variations - the regular Weedwood Rowboat, as well as a **Tarred Weedwood Rowboat**. It can also be outfitted with an upgrade, the **Weedwood Rowboat Lantern Upgrade.**

Crafting Recipes
------------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Weedwood Rowboat** | Weedwood Planks (5) |  |
| **Weedwood Rowboat Lantern Upgrade** | Weedwood Plank Slab (3) + Reed Rope (2) + Weedwood Planks (3) + Firefly (item) |  |

How to Use
------------

Like vanilla boats, the Weedwood Rowboat can be placed by right-clicking it on water, where it can then be mounted with right-click, seating one player, and exited with crouch. Entering the rowboat immediately puts the player in third-person mode (unless disabled in the config), with the player facing the back of the boat. The boat can still be ridden in first person by pressing F5.

The Rowboat's oars are both separately controlled to steer it in different directions. Pressing left will paddle the left oar, steering the boat to the right, and pressing right will paddle the right oar, steering the rowboat to the left. Pressing both left and right at the same time will make both oars paddle, moving the boat forwards. Players can hold the buttons to paddle continuously, or tap them before a row is finished to paddle even faster, useful for accelerating or turning quickly. The boat will also slow faster when turning. While rowing, a special arm animation for the player is used and a unique paddling sound will play.

The Weedwood Rowboat moves much faster than swimming normally, and can protect players against hostile aquatic mobs from below. Its movement is also unhindered by Algae, although it will lose speed and bounce off of mobs or blocks it bumps into. In certain situations, a Lurker Skin Shield used as a raft may be easier to deploy and control, albeit slower and not as protective.

A Weedwood Rowboat can be broken and collected by punching it a few times.

Upgrading
-----------

### Tarring
Regular Weedwood Rowboats can be difficult to control, as they tend to drift and turn randomly. Right-clicking on a regular Weedwood Boat with Tar Drip will turn it into a Tarred Weedwood Boat, which will stop the boat from drifting randomly, making it easier to control.

### Lantern
A Weedwood Rowboat Lantern Upgrade can be right-clicked onto the boat to place a lantern at the front, illuminating a small area around it with shaders, similar to the glow of a Firefly.
