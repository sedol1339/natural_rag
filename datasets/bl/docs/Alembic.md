Crafting Recipe
-----------------

| Result | Ingredients | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Alembic** | Cragrock (2) + Octine Ingot (2) + Green Dentrothyst + Green Dentrothyst Vial |  |

How to Use
------------

To begin the process of distilling, simply right-click the Alembic with an Infusion Bucket, derived from the results of an Infuser. The contents of the bucket will be transferred to the larger still container of the Alembic, which will begin slowly distilling and transferring to the smaller receiving vial. The Alembic will emit steam and flame particles during this process as well.

Once the distilling process is complete, the result can be obtained by right-clicking the Alembic with either type of Dentrothyst Vial. What result it yields depends on the contents of the original Infusion Bucket:

* If distilling a mixture with a valid Aspect combination and infusion time, it will yield the corresponding Infusion, its potency and duration determined by the amount of certain ingredients that were in the original bucket, and the number of Infusions obtained determined by the total amount of all Aspects that were in it.
* If distilling any other mixture, it will yield Aspect Vials, one per Aspect included, the amount in each depending on the total amount of that Aspect in the original bucket (there is a 15% loss of each Aspect when distilling this way).
