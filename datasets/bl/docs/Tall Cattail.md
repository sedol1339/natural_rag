Collection
------------

Tall Cattails must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop a Cattail Head, which can then be ground into Ground Cattail.

Growing
---------

Tall Cattails will grow to adjacent plant-supporting blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Compostability
----------------

Tall Cattails have a compost process time of 8 minutes and 20 seconds and a compost amount of 6. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.

Events
--------

Placed Tall Cattails will take on alternative textures during the Spook and Winter seasonal events.
