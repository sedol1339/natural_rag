Obtaining
-----------

### Spread
Dug Purified Swamp Grass is created when Swamp Grass or Dug Swamp Grass spreads to Dug Purified Swamp Dirt.

Properties
------------

### Coloration
Dug Purified Swamp Grass takes on different grass colors depending on what biome it is in. The grass color is:

* #7CBD6B if in the inventory
* #6BC44E in Coarse Islands, Raised Isles, and Swamplands Clearing biomes
* #E5F745 in Deep Waters biomes
* #627017 in Marsh biomes
* #1FC66D to  #1FC63D in Patchy Islands biomes
* #5B3522 in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes
* #2AFF00 to  #50A040 in Swamplands biomes

### Composting
Right-clicking on Dug Purified Swamp Grass with Compost will fill the hole in the grass with compost, allowing crops to be planted on it and plants to grow on it.

### Plant Support
Dug Purified Swamp Grass supports the placement and growth of basic plants.

When composted, Dug Purified Swamp Grass supports the growth of White Pear Plants by planting White Pear Seeds, Yellow Dotted Fungus by planting Spores, and Aspectrus Plants by planting Aspectrus Seeds on a Rubber Tree Plank Fence on top of it.

Composted Dug Purified Swamp Grass also allows basic plants placed on it to grow to other plant-supporting blocks adjacent to the composted block.

Note that the compost inside the Dug Purified Swamp Grass will be depleted after enough crop or plant harvests from it. It will also revert to regular Dug Swamp Grass after six harvests of a fully grown plant.

### Decay
Unlike other dug blocks, Dug Purified Swamp Grass that is not composted will not revert to a non-dug form, as there is none.

Unlike Dug Swamp Dirt and Dug Swamp Grass, composted Dug Purified Swamp Grass will never decay, and crops growing on it will never decay either.

### Spreading & Death
Dug Purified Swamp Grass will spread to nearby Dug Purified Swamp Dirt over time. It can also spread to Swamp Dirt and Dug Swamp Dirt, turning them into Swamp Grass and Dug Swamp Grass respectively.

Dug Purified Swamp Grass will eventually become Dug Purified Swamp Dirt if a solid block is placed directly on top of it.

Drops
-------

Dug Purified Swamp Grass drops Swamp Dirt when broken. The block itself cannot be collected in Survival Mode.
