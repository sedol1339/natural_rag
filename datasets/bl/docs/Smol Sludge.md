**Smol Sludges** are miniature slime-like creatures that lurk in Sludge Plains and Sludge Plains Clearing biomes, as well as in Swamplands Clearing sub-biomes after the Spirit Tree in their center has been defeated. They also have a chance to be spawned when a Large Sludge Worm is damaged.

Description
-------------

Smol Sludges are smaller variations of normal Sludges. They appear as relatively cubic blobs of murky brown sludge with an animated skull in their center. They are all the same size.

When first spawned, they may or may not be visible and if not will be submerged within a dirt-type block, such as Swamp Dirt, Mud, or Sludgy Dirt. If a player comes close enough, they will leap out of the mud to attack. Like slimes, they move by hopping about and attack with melee, but they do not split when killed. Unlike regular Sludges, they do not create slowing sludge trails.

Smol Sludges can be killed in one hit using a rare loot weapon, the Sludge Slicer.

Strategy
----------

While they may not look too powerful, Sludges are rather deceptive. They move quicker than you would expect a slime-type creature to, and they hide in blocks only leaping out when you least expect it. Their attacks are also very rapid. The best way to deal with them is just to kill them as soon as possible to minimize the damage they will inflict on you, or to retreat if they begin to swarm. While they lack the slowing sludge trails of regular Sludges, their small size makes them trickier targets and they can fit through smaller gaps, so be wary.

Drops
-------
