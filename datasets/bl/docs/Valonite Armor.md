A full set of Valonite Armor boasts the protection of 20 armor points, or 10 armor icons, and absorbs 80% of damage dealt to the player wearing it at the cost of durability. There are no set bonuses from a full set of Valonite Armor.

Repairing
-----------

Like most other equipment with durability, any damaged piece of Valonite Armor can be repaired to full durability through an Animator. The more that needs to be repaired, the greater the cost of fuel and crystal charge is in the animation process.

Middle Gems
-------------

As with most equipment, all pieces of Valonite Armor can be equipped with a Middle Gem as part of the Middle Gem Circle to apply additional buffs to the player wearing them. The type of gem equipped can be seen visibly on the armor as well as in its tooltip. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.
