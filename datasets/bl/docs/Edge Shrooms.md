Placement
-----------

Edge Shrooms can only be placed between the top and the side of two blocks, lying on the edge they create.

Collection
------------

Edge Shrooms must be harvested with Syrmorite Shears to be collected. When harvested with a Sickle, they instead drop Edge Shroom Gills, which can then be ground into Ground Edge Shroom.

Growing
---------

Edge Shrooms will grow to adjacent plant-supporting edges between blocks when on top of composted Dug Swamp Dirt, Dug Swamp Grass, Dug Purified Swamp Dirt, or Dug Purified Swamp Grass. Like other Sludgeon plants, they must also be placed in the range of an active Censer that is being sourced with Bottled Fog in order to grow. However, their growth will halt if the composted block they are growing on becomes decayed, or if its compost is depleted after enough harvests.

Potting
---------

Edge Shrooms can be placed decoratively inside of Mud Brick Flower Pots with a right-click. They can then be taken out by right-clicking the pot again.

Compostability
----------------

Edge Shrooms have a compost process time of 5 minutes and a compost amount of 8. Visit the Compost page for more information regarding the composting mechanic.
