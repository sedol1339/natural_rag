### Trimming
All Middle Gems can be obtained from trimming a *treasure* Anadia item with Slender or Stubby body type (that is not rotten) in the Trimming Table. In the case of the Stubby body type, the amount obtained per item depends on the Anadia's Size attribute, with larger sizes yielding more gems.

### Loot
All Middle Gems can be found as Loot from Item Shelves in the Labyrinthine Vaults of the Sludgeon.

They can also be found as scattered items in Chiromaw Matriarch Nests.

Uses
------

### Upgrading
All Middle Gems can be used as upgrades for any piece of Amphibious Armor by shift right-clicking the armor piece and placing the item in one or more of its upgrade slots (up to 3 can be placed in each slot). Each slot with a Middle Gem upgrade gives the armor piece the same bonuses as the gem would normally provide when equipped. Only one type of Middle Gem can be used to upgrade per armor piece, but multiple of the same type can be used, although the effects do not stack.

Each Middle Gem item at the top of an upgrade stack will receive durability damage when the armor itself is damaged, and will retain this durability loss even if taken out of the armor, becoming unstackable with other Middle Gem items even of the same type. Each item has a maximum durability of 64 before breaking, and the armor will then start using the next item down if it was stacked.

#### Middle Gem Circle
All Middle Gems can be applied via crafting to most Tools and Weapons (encompassing Shovels, Pickaxes, Axes, Swords and other melee weapons, and Bows), Shields, Armor, and empty Amulets, providing them with unique varying bonuses. The gem applied to the equipment can be seen in the equipment's tooltip, and sometimes visually on its texture as well. The bonuses provided can be seen on the gem's own tooltip.

Middle Gems *can* be applied to non-Betweenlands equipment, although they will never appear on the item's texture.

Amphibious Armor cannot be crafted with Middle Gems, but can be upgraded with them instead.

See the Middle Gem Circle page for more details.
